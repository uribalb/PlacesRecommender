I had ordered a house lo mein chicken wings and ribs like usual and had a taste for pineapple on the side when i receives my delivery like always i tip the driver well and before i could get settled into my meal i noticed that my pineapple was missing so i called and notified them and i wanted them to bring it before they closed for the night and they told me they couldnt and i would have to get it the next day because their driver was gone home for the next which is not my problem i called 5 mins after he delivered to my house so i dont see why they couldnt reach him its not like we don't have cell phones in this age so I felt put off and dishonoured as a valued customer since every time I order I spend about $40 every time. So the next day I call and have to re explain with my receipt in hand and order number they promised they would bring it and they never called or showed up so I waited a day then called again and the same thing happened so at this point I'm never ordering from them again such a big disappointment",2015-09-24 14:10:13

We stumbled upon it (literally stumbled... we'd been drinking margs) and were so surprised to find such a cute ice cream shop in a place we'd passed by hundreds of times. Complete with a counter and swivel stools, Rosalena's offers all your old school ice cream standards (all Bassett's ice cream mmm) as well as Italian sodas and a few fried things for you unlucky lactose intolerants. It's the perfect place for a milkshake sharing date. Just be warned though, margaritas, mexican food and ice cream aren't exactly the best combo. Learned that one the hard way.",2008-05-15 14:14:42

Not great @ all!  Supposedly you should make reservations and I did, but when we got there, only five other tables were occupied!  Hostess was a major bitch and had a major snoot attitude -- not friendly at all!

Started with chicken dumplings....essentially just steamed dumplings w/ a ginger infused soy sauce....B-O-R-I-N-G.

Had the vegetable lasagna....AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!  Boiled veggies on a still wet and slippery lasagna pasta, and then smothered with sauce and a little bit of ricotta?!  No way!  It was COLD and WARM spots during the consumption....the restaurant was NOT busy to churn out that kind of product....

No, never will come back.  I make it my point to always thank the hostess and ususally (if you have any common sense), it is customary to say goodbye and/or thank you....the bitches in front said SQUAT and looked confused....",2007-06-08 18:02:52

Don't let the Victorian look or the fact that there's nothing resembling spaghetti and meatballs on the menu. This one's an Italian restaurant in a league of it's own, best gone down on when you have time to spare. The pacing here is old world, while the food is so of the new.

Me and a buncha friends came here during restaurant week and ordered from that menu. I got the Summer Gazpacho, which has spiced shrimp, piment d'espelette, parsley croutons in it, the 12oz prime rib, and the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse. The gaspacho was alright... first time I ever tried it. The prime rib was advertised to be medium rare, but it came out to be medium well for me. Way overdone. But nonetheless it wasn't too bad... at least the tender parts anyway. And you can't go wrong with the chocolate mousse cake. Four stars for the place, though I feel it could've been better if they didn't serve everyone at once. It seemed like they cooked appetizers for everyone and then entrees for everyone to make it more efficient. That may be why the steak was overcooked.",2006-09-16 19:16:42

Why you ask? Well I'll tell you the best around is pick up only and is cash only. When I have that magic double formula at my disposal I go straight to number 5 (locals will know) however when that criteria is not met, when I need delivery or I need to use a credit card I need a place that is up to the task of serving awesome Chinese food. Enter Pearl of the East. Its been my standby for years but a car smashed through the window a couple years ago and I forgot all about this place. Well I ordered tonight. Its as good as I remember and as I type this I'm thinking I might even like the garlic sauce better then number 5. Add the fact that they were not cheap with a random assortment of sauce packets and gave a whopping 8 fortune cookies with my order (which included a free quart of won ton soup for meeting a certain dollar spent threshhold).

I am however, proud to admit that my first was at Roselena's. And it was damn good. It's creamy. It's sweet. It's refreshing. It's worth trying if you're like me and didn't grow up around here eating monkey bread and 'wuder' ice 'down the shaw'.

We were out last week checking out our hood since the weather has finally opened up a bit. It was a Friday night at around 11 and Passyunk was pretty busy. Not much was open but this quaint little tea shop slash old school ice cream parlor. They had tables out on the sidewalk and everyone had a plate with half-eaten dessert of some sort left on it. We decided to stop and have a bite. 

Along with the Italian cream, we ordered the Passyunk S'more and man, it was outrageous. And aptly named! They piled up this super rich chocolate and graham crackers in what seemed like 6-7 layers. Top that off with a mound of marshmallows that they fire right at your table with a blowtorch. You basically extinguish the flames when the mallows are charred to your liking.

Not only did everything they had look tasty (we wanted everything), but I couldn't help but notice a sign that says ""$1.00 coffee - any size"". Sure enough, I was there at 7 the next morning for that. How can you go wrong with gourmet coffee that doesn't taste like it's been burning for hours for $1.00. That kind of thing just doesn't happen these days. I've since been there at least once a day - and sometimes twice. They've always got a great selection and it's always fresh. 

I have so many yelps to write, but this morning I went for my coffee and they had an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe which seriously made my day. So as I sit here savoring it, I felt compelled to come out and say how much I love Roselena's.",2008-05-03 12:52:52

They offered outside dining, which was nice, but I think they forgot about us.  Let me list the reasons why the service sucked.
1 - Never got a refill on my beverage, or asked if I wanted one.
2 - Never had my water refilled, was finally asked after I finished my meal.
3 - Friend asked for more water and it took asking a second time asking after waiting 20 minutes.
4 - Food was not served together, I was done with my meal before my wife even got hers.
5 - It took 45 minutes after we finished eating to get our check, and this was after we got tired of waiting and walked up to the register.
6 - Our appetizers were rather thrown down on the table nearly knocking over a drink.
7 - We had to flag our server down at least 3 times.

For $22 on average for an entree, I would expect better service.  I can goto a Dennys/IHOP and get better service.

I was planning a business lunch to demo some of my company's products.  You know, it's hard to plan lunch for 30 people in a city you've only visited that's more than 3000 miles away.  But it was pretty easy at Twenty 21.  

My coworker who lives in Philly recommended it, but she'd never been before.  Brenda and her staff made everything really easy.  The room isn't completely private - so we were afraid that the lunch crowd noise would feed over - but no worries.  They have 3 options of private dining menus - with meat, veggie, and non-redmeat options.  Reports from the team who went to the lunch was that this was the 2nd best meal of the 5 they had.

But how do I really know that Twenty 21 is a great place for events?  My notoriously hard to please coworker in Philly - used it last week for a graduation dinner for her daughter...that says enough for me :)",2007-06-12 23:52:12

I went in this afternoon and ordered a chicken panini sandwich to go, and I sat down and patiently waited. The inside is very kitschy and has a 50's diner throwback feeling; it seemed like fun and I thought perhaps I would return for a meal.

About ten minutes later I some people came in and over the course of the next several minutes not one, not two, not three - FOUR different employees asked me if I had been helped. I believe one of them was the titular Roselena.

After another FIVE minutes I asked someone if they could check up on my order to see what was going on. He disappeared and came back to say it would be ""2 minutes."" The perhaps-she-was-Roselena woman said that the delay was probably because of a change in shifts.

Five minutes later, after a total of 25 minutes of waiting (which was easy to clock because a TV showing an episode of ""King of Queens"" went through an entire episode while I was there,) I left. Roselena-lady asked me if I was going. I said ""Well, I ordered just one sandwich and it's been almost half an hour. I think that's unreasonable. But thank you.""

She seemed very irritated, but more over the loss of money than my having been treated badly. She did not apologize.

So like I said - I'd love to tell you all about how great the food at Roselena's was. But I never will be able to, because I never got any, and I don't give second chances.",2008-05-22 01:18:29

The entree pairings were  unique and the servers were excited to educate you about them.  For instance, as a complement to my tuna I had purple rice , which was new to me.  The server was happy to tell me it came from Japan and brought me out a plate of what it looks like dried, even suggested where to purchase some.  

There is a lot of space in the restaurant and the servers keep their distance so it is a great place for a business dinner.  For those of you who are not so fortunate to expense this dinner, with entrees costing about $30 ea, you may find pleasure in knowing two tidbits:
1) Tuesdays are BYOB nights 
2)  Fridays have $35 three course menus

They have this retro ice-cream parlour atmosphere with a quick breakfast/sandwich shop menu and loads of nick-nacks, minature classic cars, coffee paraphernalia and other stuff that makes it look like something that should have existed in the fifties.  The reason it works is because of its location. East Passyunk is a bit like a time warp itself, so having this anachronism tucked away on this street is perfect.

It's sweet, almost like if Cane's sauce, mayo, and honey mustard had a delicious, delicious baby. The online ordering process was pretty easy and simple, and my food was ready earlier than promised. 

There are a few kinks that might need to be worked out, but nothing super serious. I asked for my sauce to be on the side in the comments since this was my first time here and I wasn't sure if I'd like it. Instead, I got sauce on the fries PLUS an extra side of sauce. No big deal because I ended up liking it, but if I didn't I'd be pretty annoyed. Also, the cashier seemed really confused about my order. I said my name, and he could see that the bag said my name, but for some reason it printed out that I was a door dash order despite ordering directly from their website.

First off the staff there always seems a bit confused on what is going on in regards to tables, drink specials, ect.  This instance was no different.  Throughout the entire DNC coverage the TV was going in and out with either the sound not working or the picture disappearing.  Then to top it off 5 minutes into Obama's speech the TVs in the entire restaurant go dead.  Which ruined being able to see the speech entirely.

I haven't had Indian food in 2 months and was in desperate need for a fix. After stumbling upon Passage to India in a Philadelphia magazine quoted for ""symphonies of flavor"" I was wildly disappointed. 

AFV on TV in the background? Are you serious?

My chicken curry could have been made better and fresher if I had dumped a pack of curry spice from Stop and Shop in some chicken. The buffet had some decent choices, but wasn't award winning in any way. 

The atmosphere was poor. I think this was an old cheap hotel lobby they never bothered to update and clean up. It was not air conditioned (for a place that serves spicy food on a 95 degree day??, really?). The waitstaff was inattentive and way too soft-spoken.  I asked three times for the check, to only find out you had to go up to the front to pay and get the check (thanks for the heads up).The counter was filthy and all of their paperwork was just jammed into shelves behind the desk. Classy.  I was thisclose to walking out and not paying. Now, you really need to piss me off for me to even CONSIDER that.

Went here with a friend last night, since he wanted to try this place out.  I have had decent Indian food in Philly before, so I wasn't expecting anything too bad.

First of all, this place was a ghost town.  Only two other people were there.  Two older guys, and they were eating alone.  I shan't say more, that might be me some day.

Second,  the manager or owner or whoever he was, was eating dinner right in the front, so as soon as we walked in, we saw him.  He waved us in with his greasy tandoori chicken hand.   Couldn't he have taken a seat in the back of the restaurant, since it's such a huge space and NO ONE was there.

The place has nice decor, lots of tables.  There was a tv playing Bollywood videos.  I love me some Bollywood, so that was awesome.

We decided on the buffet for dinner.  It was very sparse to say the least.  I had the chicken tikka masala and rice and some saag with chicken (spinach with chicken).  I was so underwhelmed.  The food was lukewarm, even cold in some spots.  It seemed as if it had been sitting out for a while.  The chicken tikka was horrid, burnt chicken with tasteless sauce.  I had had enough and this was my first plate.

I really can't say anymore since I was so disappointed, I refused to subject my stomach to anymore of the disastrous concoctions.

Waterside Cafe serves a variety of breakfast sandwich options until 1030AM. For Lunch, I recommend their turkey bacon lettuce wrap or pressed cuban sandwich with drink and chips or banana meal deal for $6. I usually get the following extra toppings for it at no extra charge: Jalapenos, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and mushrooms. Waterside Cafe's Caesar salad and meatball sub are also pretty good. I haven't tried their pizza yet. Service is kind of rushed and there staff speaks mostly Spanish and wasn't the most helpful with questions.

                            Restaurant review 1 - Arelis Restaurant


  For my first Restaurant review I went to eat in Arelis Restaurant which is in Camden NJ 2198 River Road street. Arelis restaurant is a Spanish restaurant where their most popular servings are mostly white, yellow Spanish rice with chicken. The Hispanics who run the restaurant are Dominicans so they also had foods from the Dominican Republic such as ""platano"" and ""magoo"". Not only did Arelis serve Spanish food, but they also serve food that are common in America such as Cheesesteak, Spaghetti, Cheese burgers and French fries. They also serve seafood such as fish and shrimp. Arelis restaurant was pretty small, it had a large painting of a very green forest with a river in it in the middle and on the right had the flags of a lot of Hispanic countries like Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican, ect. It also has the American flag.
    I went to eat at Arelis Restaurant, Saturday February 25, 2017 in approximately 3:00 pm. It is a small restaurant with only about 5-6 tables and I decided to sit on the empty one. It being such a small restaurant, a busy one especially on Saturdays, it took quite a while for one of the waitresses to notice me especially since at that time they were understaffed. However, as more waitresses arrive to work I was able to get served a little earlier than usual. One of the waitresses that served me was a young girl who I personally know that comes through as a member at my job at the Kroc center. Before I ordered we had a small conversation about our lives. After our small conversation, I was ready to order and through their menu I picked Spaghetti with shrimp since I was in the mood for Pasta. After picking Spaghetti with shrimp as my food of choice the waitress asked if there was any drinks that I wanted. For my drink, I picked sprite soda since I was in a mood for something sugary. The waitress wrote it down and told me the food will be ready in about 20 minutes. As I was waiting for my food, the restaurant was getting more crowded to the point where there weren't some seats left for some of the custumers. After about 20 minutes, my meal arrived and I had about a medium-large size yellow Spaghetti. I found the spaghetti shrimp to be very delicious and it took me maybe less than 10 minutes to demolish my whole plate. 
    After eating at Arelis restaurant, I would definitely come back and eat there again. However, I would recommend coming around the afternoon around 2 or 3 o'clock if you are the type that likes to have a quick service. If you are the type of person who likes eating at big restaurants and have a quick service then would not recommend you to go o Arelis. If you don't mind eating at a small restaurant but just like to be one of the few custumers that receives a quick service I would recommend to go there around the weekdays where it is less busy. I am definitely a fan of Arelis restaurant and will return to eat there!",2017-03-02 17:59:40

It also represented a potentially livening facet of the Arcadia court, which I had previously dismissed as a haven for upper middle class tourists willing to spend too much on living room art.

On first approach: a terraced rock fountain onto which ""Stateside"" was light-projected to great effort.  Ok, a bit much.  Some more steps inside revealed an open, almost cavernous modern interior, complete with NY-style underlighted bar and stage in the corner. 

Actually, though, not so bad.  I like it for what it's trying to bring in terms of real city feel, even if Stateside is consciously aware of that fact.  The food was inventive, but not extraordinary.  Specifically, the ceviche was oddly and petitely served in small shot glasses, and my  tuna steak came cooked ala dessicant (read: well done).  But the jazz trio in the corner was a mediating factor.

I'm willing to stick with the game for a while, to see what they end up making of it, even if ""Stateside"" is streaked in light in pretentious small-caps font.",2007-11-17 06:02:33

The waiter suddenly reappears with the menu and thankfully, 2 mimosas in hand and said he'd be ""right back"" to get our orders.  We waited another 10 minutes before he came back to our table.

Bleah!   Basically the only good thing I can say is that the service is prompt... probably because the place is usually empty.",2008-08-10 17:44:48

The drink menu is very good.  We tried five, liked all of them, and especially liked the Blue Cosmo, Lichitini and Rollis Stolli.  We tried the squash blossoms appetizer and enjoyed them (of course it's hard to screw up fried foods).  We both loved the arugula salad.  My wife had the seabass and said it was good, but not great.  Very tender, but not all that flavorful.  I had the short ribs; we both agreed they were great.  Very tender with good flavor; if you like wasabi you'll love the wasabi mashed potatoes.  

We finished with the chocolate chocolate mousse(?) and the caramel creme brulet.  Both were good, but not great.

Service started out a little slow, but improved.

We really liked the ambiance and the decor.  Very loungy, big-city feel.  Music was good (chill-out stuff, heard some Jem and Bjork).  Upstairs was cool with couches, good place to hang out.  The bar was nice and big.  The only thing we didn't like was the presence of three big screen TVs.  They were nice, but (in our opinion) didn't fit the vibe.

All in all, Stateside deserves a return trip.",2007-11-18 05:30:18

I went in today and ordered my usual... the spaghetti and meatballs lunch special, which until today, was one of my favorite spaghetti plates in the area. When the food arrived, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes atop and was preparing to chow down when I noticed that the food appeared to be moving. After a fleeting moment of shock, I realized that there were what appeared to be giant weevils all over my food. 

Fighting back instant nausea, I started looking for the source, as it seemed unlikely that weevils would live in a cooked spaghetti sauce. I found the colony in the red pepper flake container, where there were hundreds of them crawling around inside, indicating to me that this was not their first day on the scene. I wonder if people were inadvertently sprinkling their unhatched eggs onto their food earlier in the week?? Oh god. 

I call over the lady at the cash register and inform her of the situation... she takes the plate and the pepper container with a brief apology. Meanwhile, several of the large weevils take to flight and start kamikazeing into the other people sitting at the table........ after smashing as many of the little buggers as we could, the lady brings out a fresh plate of spaghetti. 

I was so hungry, I managed to eat most of the spaghetti, but by the time I killed those first hunger pains, my appetite was gone as I started recalling the image of all those bugs squirming around on my first plate... UGH. 

I really loved Joe's spaghetti, and pretty much ate there on a weekly basis with several of my work colleagues. They were as disgusted as I was and we've all agreed that it's time to scratch Sepie's from our list of lunchtime eateries. 

I was also a little annoyed at the owner for not bothering to personally come out and see what was going on. There was no apology or concession of any kind. Now, I'm not in the restaurant business, but it seems as though a ""bugs in the food"" problem with one of the guests would be one of those things that, as an owner, would garner my full attention. 

BOTTOM LINE: Perhaps the restaurant's peculiar mothball aroma has a deeper mean than I originally thought... ?? Regardless, I will never eat here again.",2012-08-22 18:01:32

In fact, I stop here when I have that exact craving (which is often), and it is the only thing I care about getting when I do stop in. The marinara is made just to my liking, not too sweet, but not overwhelming with garlic and the other ""salty"" flavors... and the meatballs are giant, and VERY well prepared. I have a hard time finding meatballs that meet my personal requirements for awesomeness, but never when Joe Sepie is the cook. 

Today I stopped in with a couple of my cohorts from work and one of them ventured outside of our safety zone and picked up the day's special: Italian sausage and peppers with an alfredo sauce over angel hair. Although I would never get anything other than the spaghetti and meatballs, this other plate looked pretty yummy... and according to my buddy, tasted as good as it looked. 

I come to Joe Sepie's for a quick, delicious, and inexpensive lunch. They easily meet that requirement every time I go, so they get a 4 star from Matt R. 

But....... if I were coming here for a romantic dinner with the wife, the mothball aroma, Fox News background noise, and other less than perfect environmental conditions of the eatery would probably play a factor in my rating.

Cons:
- good quality ingredients but poorly cooked

Love or Hate it, you gotta live with it if you are a Micronite.  Sadly, many of my co-workers only eat there at gunpoint.  

I feel that it is diamond in the rough as it has good quality ingredients.  I notice this when they are making the the sandwiches in front of you and the stuff they use is no different than what you see at good quality delies like Specialities.  It's certainly better ingredients than subway.  But sadly, the sandwiches aren't made well- soaking wet sandwiches, whole leafs of lettuce.  I don't blame the staff because there's no motivation for them to care or do a good job.  If they do a better job, they still get paid the same.  I think the contracting company should reward merit.  If they serve more of their items, than the staff should be rewarded accordingly.  It's win-win-win.  We the customer win, the staff win, and the contractors win.   

Their baked goods staff are really good.  I recommend getting a holiday pie when they offer a really good selection during thanksgiving/Christmas.",2009-06-13 22:01:45

A few people order & she says, well cant you do drinks & food together? okay... so we get that straightened out & she gets to the 3rd person & my friend pauses for two seconds, and the waitress says, ~""Look, Should I come back later?

Overall I think the food is really quite good, but let's not mince words: the location is a dive. They recently spruced up the paint and gave it a bit of a makeover, but lipstick on a pig blah blah blah. But hey, I'm not scared by divey locations, not if the owners appear to care about upkeep. There is a difference between a dive and a sh*thole, and this is a dive, which is fine. Anyway, the food is really what counts, and for my money (and not much of it either!) the food is really quite good and consistent. Trivia: these guys used to be in Harding Mall, back when it wasn't a Walmart, and moved up the road when it got knocked down. Anyway, food: I'm not sure what they do to their ""ranch sauce"" but it's delightful and if you get fries always go for the seasoning they offer. I generally stick to their gyro meat (a blend of lamb and beef) but the chicken is a strong choice too. The food is fresh and the staff is friendly. I would call this more ""Mediterranean"" than Greek (splitting hairs?) but mostly because the people who run it are Egyptian, so I think that brings a slightly different flavor profile to the food other than what a straight up Greek influence would. So, yeah, this is a down and dirty kind of place, great for a fast lunch and some arabic language TV, which is always entertaining.",2011-04-20 15:25:39

This location is a a weird place and its been like 3 different stores since i last live in this neighborhood. The parking lot is intense even for the yuppers in Greenville.

I decided on the Cosi oatmeal with berries and brown sugar. It was hearty and filling . My only gripe is that they serve it in a cup/bowl thats a little on the small side for mixing up the additions that they plop on top. Please invest in some larger bowl.s  You can add a small coffee for 1.00 which is a steal and while its not La Columbe it did the trick.

With the free wifi i was able to get in a quick rosetta stone french lesson while i munched on my hearty breakfast.

Well. We went in for Sunday Brunch.  We where promptly seated and all seemed well. After we were seated the madness began. It took 30 minutes (no lie) for our waiter to acknowledge us. The funny part about this was that they were not busy. During our wait our waiter chatted up a lady. I don't know if she was his S.O. or if he was just trying to get a number or what ever... Anyway we saw people get up and leave and I think we even witnessed a group dine and run.

This restaurant looks all fancy, is in a nice area of town, and they get away with serving people hot dogs under the name of turkey sausage??!!? WTF?  I talked to the waiter about it and he seemed miffed that I would call it a hot dog. What ever. At this point we were already pissed off. Arguing with me about this just really pissed me off.

After eating two of them I discovered that the others smelled like ammonia and were coated in slime. After doing a google search I read that those were the qualities of expired crabs.

I woke up this morning with the intention of returning them before the store became overly crowded. I did not want to cause unnecessary attention because I do frequently buy my crabs from there and have never experienced this. I was met with nasty customer service and wasted 30 minutes of my day, time and even my gas. First a man came over and opened the container, begin breaking and sniffing the crabs , as if I had any reason to lie and inconvenience myself. He could clearly tell they were not eaten. He then stated that because they were broken in half they were not able to place them on display in exchange for new crabs. I let him know that an exchange would not be acceptable because they were rotten. He then went and got a woman who came over and picked up where he left off stating the same stupid bullshit. Needless to say only half of what I couldn't eat was replaced , but they commenced to argue with me distributing poor accountability , which is clearly disappointing  for a regular customer. Ultimately it was resolved however I will NEVER purchase anything from there again and I am advising everyone else to beware !

THE BIGGEST DONAIRS IN THE CITY. DON'T BELIEVE? COME IN AND TRY.

So I parked my car and walked in.

I wasn't starving, so I ordered a mushroom donair with onion rings.

The donair was great. Absolutely stuffed to bursting with lettuce, onions, tomato, meat and mushrooms (although the sweet sauce could have been a bit zestier). Same with the onion rings - the plate was loaded with these crunchy babies.

Prior to that and just before taking my order, I noticed the guy behind the counter creating a......a monster , a........a behemoth, a..........a freak of nature - he was making a Jumbo donair.

The Jumbo donairs at Adams are frickin HUGE! The man making the donair told another customer that it is nearly two pounds and four inches thick. And get this, it's only 10 bucks!

I've tried many donair shops in E-town but I've never seen anything the size of Adam's Jumbo donair - crazy big.

That's why I gave this restaurant 5 stars. Adam's doesn't skimp on anything. For a reasonable price you get a shyt load of good, tasty food.

And they don't just offer donairs. They also have burgers, salads, pitas, wings and an assortment of Lebanese food.

I'd like to meet the person who could finish one of their Jumbo donairs in one sitting. I'd be contacting Ripley's Believe It Or Not if they could.

I started out with some bread, which was pita bread accompanied by hummus. The pita bread was decent, but the hummus had way way too much garlic in it. The butternut squash soup I had sounded better than it actually tasted. It didn't have the right taste that you'd expect from butternut squash. It looked good. However, it didn't taste good and the consistency was more like mashed vegetable cooked in water.

For the entree I had chicken with a dijon cream sauce in capers and sundried tomatoes. Sounds good, right? Sadly, it wasn't. The chicken was moist and tender, but that was the only decent thing about this. The sundried tomatoes were present, but must have been old or overcooked because they didn't lend any flavor that I could detect. The djion cream sauce could have been good, but there were way too many capers in it and that overpowered everything else.

I had a lemon tart and coffee for dessert. The lemon tart was served with a spoon. This particular tart came with a very hard/thick crust, which made eating with a spoon almost impossible. Luckily I have strong hands so i was able to carve out bites. There was plenty of lemon flavoring, but a bit much lemon zest in it.

Service was the bright note here. The waitress, the host/owner/manger?, and the cook were all very nice. I'd like to come back and try something else and see if it was just this dish/night.

I went for lunch recently, about 1:30. There was one other customer in the place. This on a very pleasant weekday in downtown St. Louis. 
I ordered a sandwich and a Coke (actually a ""pressata"" and a Coke). Came to almost $9. This is why I bring my lunch to work most days, because it's hard to get a sandwich downtown that isn't overpriced. But $9? Come on. 
Then, when it arrived... well, in my experience, Cuban sandwiches and barbecue pulled pork sandwiches are two different things. But apparently Balada's sees it differently. 
While the menu mentioned pickles, onions, mustard and cheese in ""The Cuban,"" all that was between the ""pressata"" buns was a big slab of pulled pork drenched in barbecue sauce (there may have been some tiny onions in there, but it was hard to tell). I was really looking forward to a Cuban. Instead I got pulled pork. And I can assure you, I've had better pulled pork.
So here I am, eating an overpriced sandwich I didn't order, in a nearly deserted cafeteria style ""bistro"" in the center of our depressing-ass downtown, and it occurs to me, is that Celine Dion on the radio? It is. And so's the next song. And the song after that. The third one was even God Bless America. It appears they were playing an entire album of the overwrought Quebecois songstress. By this point, I'm about ready to shoot myself.

Because this is less a ""Meh"" I've had better than just a plain dispassionate statement that while this place was fine, I have indeed had better.  That doesn't make Moore's ""bad"".  So think of this as 2.5 stars....okay that said.

This morning my wife and I ""cheated"" on our old steady, regular, dependable Main Street (closer to home). It was just one of those things where you feel like you want a fling- you don't want a permanent change, you just want something different.  We kind of got what we deserved for being disloyal. It's funny how that works with most things in life and not just restaurants.  That wild night with a stranger in ""Vegas"" rarely works out for either party.

So on to Moore's restaurant. She got scrambled eggs, sausage and french toast. I got an omelette and ""american fries"". We ate every bite given to us. We were full and well fed. There were little things off here and there (compared to other places, but not bad), it was made well, just seemed like the starting point was frozen or ready to heat vs. made from scratch.  Again, not bad food, just not quite what some other reviews, here and google, raved about.  I guess its just a matter of exposure to the wider world and other options.

One other point and not a complaint, just an observation. You ever felt ""tolerated"" versus truly welcome?  We are a mixed couple in our early 50's, me brown and a ""never Trump"" Republican, her pink and  very Democrat. The rest of the building (maybe that part of town) was all pink and average age of 65+/-...  So no one said or did anything that we heard. Let's just say the smiles were forced. To the employees credit they were ""overly"" nice in an effort to thaw the atmosphere.

The restaurant is small, clean and nearly sterile in decor. It is very functional without any real character.  If that restaurant rescue show came along they would redecorate first and then fine tune the food quality/menu. 

If small things were fine tuned/improved and the clientele were a bit more traveled and enlightened this could be a fine little roadside gem. It's an okay , little local restaurant, but it could be so much  Moore.",2017-12-10 19:35:42

Pros:
    Food was delicious!  Bathroom was Clean!  Food was deliciously delicious.

Cons: Nappy hair in calamari!  Served on a broken plate (not just a chip but like slice your hand open sharp if I didn't notice it broken)!  Did not have the desert that was suggested by the waiter, came back and said they were out and another wait person suggested a canoli I figured what they hell.  They then charged me full price for the desert which was a single cannoli for $5?!?!?  I figured they might want to comp it since they suggested a desert they didn't have, but FIVE DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE CANNOLI???

Needless to say I'm not pleased with the staff but the food was really good and worth the price (which is reasonable)  my meal (appetizer, main course and $5 cannoli) sans nappy hair (which happens).

Based on some of the other reviews we weren't quite sure what to expect. Being both optimistic and a fan of the traditional meat and three, we decided to give it a try. And are we glad we did!  We both had an amazing breakfast. My husband's eggs were cooked over easy just as he ordered them (surprisingly difficult to get in many restaurants) and served next to the most amazing and generously portioned piece of country ham I think I've ever seen!  Fortunately I was quite hungry and eager to help him finish it. The grits were creamy and served hot and the sliced tomatoes were fresh and ripe. My own omelet was cooked perfectly (not always a given in many places) with perfectly spicy sausage in cheesy, mushroomy tastiness. We were each served a large cup of coffee and offered refills throughout the meal. The service was friendly, prompt and efficient. The owner stopped to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. I do have to note that the 'dairy' products were of the imitation variety of velveeta-like cheese, non-dairy creamer and whipped spread for butter. I admit to being a dairy snob but willingly overlook these minor items in light of the overall experience.

I was at Bistro Americana 3 times. 

VISIT NUMBER1: The first time I was there was when they first opened and I though the food was great, although my boyfriend was not convinced (his food portion was tiny). We both had a meal and shared a meat and cheese board. I liked everything but the price was over the top for what we were given. Shave off $5-8 on each item and this place would do better business.

VISIT NUMBER 2: Brunch. I was impressed by the brunch because it was presented as though you had ordered room service. Brunch wasn't like going to the diner or Denny's ....it was cute and the way you would expect a brunch to be. Since it has been months since the visit, I cannot remember what was specifically served but it was again, on the more expensive side of things. 

VISIT NUMBER 3: Brunch, again but I was refused service. My boyfriend and I had a flier that says their brunch is until 4 pm. We showed up and they were closed. I was so sad but the next week we tried again and were refused service 45 minutes before closing. The host clearly lied and said they ran out of food.....um, yeah. Now we drive by we laugh because there is no one ever in there. 

As far as service goes I would give them 3 stars. There is a creepy chef that comes out of the kitchen and asks how the food is. It's awkward but I used to just take it as a friendly gester. The host is nice (when he isn't lying and refusing service) but he has this strange demeanor....almost like an Addams Family character.",2010-04-19 06:56:39

be back. We were so excited about the menu when we all checked it out on line, that we couldn't wait for our girls night out.  First their beer selection for quality beers SUCK, We started out with Stella's and our appy's we ordered were the dilly spears that went great with beer and they were good, and Fried cheese, which were only the standard Mozzarella sticks that you can get anywhere. Three of us ordered  the Apricod , which is Apricot Wheat Ale battered fish and chips with fennel mustard slaw and ponzu wasabi sauce ...Lots of words with a lot of flavor infusion,,, Unfortunately that's all it was... Anything but flavor.  We all couldn't taste the apricot wheat ale nor could we taste the fennel in the slaw??And to me fennel is somewhat of a strong fusion?? Wonder if it was even in there..The ponzu wasabi sauce, was basically a watered down tarter sauce, no wasabi sauce here, that's for sure.
My other gal pal ordered the Beef & Beer Dip , I tried the Aus Jus that was supposed to be beer infused and it just tasted like normal beef boullion, the package type. Needless to say we were all very disappointed in our food and the beer choices that Ale Yard, seemed to advertise in the name. We Won't be back here again. There

Details - This used to be a good place for lunch. Not anymore. Went with a friend for lunch and immediately noticed empty parking lot at 1pm. Only 1 other guest. This should have been the first clue that something was wrong as this place used to do a great lunch business.

Immediately noticed smell of sewage upon entering restaurant...should have been clue #2. However, we chalked it up to  someone stinking up the bathroom which is right by the entrance and asked for a seat as far away as possible. 

My friend's meal was meh. I ordered the Brioche Cheeseburger which arrived on a kaiser roll. When I pointed that out to the waitress she said, oh yeah, they forgot to tell me we were out of Brioche rolls. What the? That is not the point. If I wanted a regular hamburger, that is what I would have ordered... the kitchen should have alerted the waitress so I could have the chance to order something else, because I would have. PS the burger was way over-cooked and I left 1/2 of it on the plate, including the entire roll which was about 1"" larger all around than the meat!

Service was inattentive at best.

When we checked out, we asked the only other staff person we had seen if she was the manager. She hesitated, but when pressed she finally said she wasn't, but ""I guess I am when the manager isn't here."" When I told her about being served something I didn't order, her response was ""oh the cook is known to do that."" Excuse me? The management allows the cook to give people food they didn't order? In what other restaurant is that allowed? 
We then asked about the overpowering smell, which was still there and obviously a plumbing issue and not just a dirty bathroom. We were informed that it is an ongoing problem that instead of fixing, the owner just pours bleach down the pipes from time to time to mask the smell!!  The Salem County board of health needs to pay a visit to this place, I'm sure it wouldn't pass inspection.

I should mention that the woman at the register did take 1/2 off of the burger, but at that point nothing could have improved that experience. Staff appeared uninterested about any of the on-going problems at this place. Whatever happened over the past couple of years to make this place go so far down hill is a real shame.

There really are not that many beers offered here, and the ones they do have are nothing special and way, waaaay overpriced. 
The service is terrible and stupid. After 4 rounds of the same drink for 5 people (total 20 drinks), the waitress still got it wrong, and that is after having told her all four times. 
Other times I have been here, the service has been equally bad. 
On top it, the food is tasteless and expensive, with fancy names but cheap taste (what about beer infused potato slices with home made dip, which in fact are just lays chips with ketchup (!) (on chips?! - yes!). 
Besides, the music is much too loud and the DJ is terrible, although he himself seems to think otherwise.

A cut of steak (which varies week to week)
Side of potatoes
House salad
and Bread pudding

The steak was extremely tender. Easily the best piece of steak that I've had at a restaurant for under $20. We thought that the bread pudding, with hints of blueberries and raspberries, was exceptionally good. 

Bottles of wine are decently priced at around $30 for about two dozen selections on their list.

The view of the street car line on St. Charles is also wonderfully charming and a perfect backdrop to dinner.

The choir the orchestra put together comprised folks from Houston, New Orleans, and other places, and yesterday, we had our big show in the Big Easy.

NOLA, if nothing else, is full of great places to eat, and Cannon's on St. Charles Avenue is one of these.  Right on the streetcar route running along the Avenue, Cannon's is a sunny and inviting place with crisp sophistication combined with a laid-back ambience that speaks of the Old South, but without the stuffy Victorian trappings and old upholstery.

The menu is generic-American/Lousianan with even a bit of Blackened Catfish, even though ""Blackened"" whatever is not really a Cajun or Creole specialty at all (I'm sure Yelpers will correct me on this), but as someone said, if the food is good, who cares?  And you will say that upon leaving Cannon's.

We began with the bread: a large-grained dark variety with a spiced butter that went perfectly with the bread - served in generous portions much to the liking of Yours Truly the Bread Freak.  Some of us had appetizers.  Crab Cakes went down quickly, I can assure you.

I'm convinced the most-difficult day-to-day aspect of front-of-house service is dealing with the punter who changes his mind at the last second.  I and two others changed our minds at the last second, and following the lead of a fourth person we all ordered the Oyster Po-Boy.  Our waiter was adaptable and on-the-spot with the changes, and everyone got the right orders.

The oysters are fried in this bad-boy, but man, oh man, what a treat!  And the bread and other things did not get in the way of the oysters.  The tomatoes, lettuce leaves, and everything else on the club, including the pickles, simply brought out the flavor of the oysters.  The one gripe I have is that the sandwich bread's immense size and the size of the oyster pieces made the whole thing unwieldy.  My side was Cream of Spinach & Artichoke that went 83% well with the sandwich, but not quite.  But who cares when it's delicious as all-get-out.

Some of us had sweet potato fries which were as light as air and tasty, though they looked a lot heavier than they turned out to be.  Everyone liked their food, and plates went back to the kitchen empty - my first lunch in the French Quarter in more than two decades, if not ever.",2009-07-14 03:14:52

The interior is very bright, and the building itself is... historical? Anyway, the only weakness I can say about it, the menu, is probably a major strength as well. The menu is large, varied, and scattered; everything from diner food: burgers, chicken, breakfast all day, to the outliers: spaghetti, tacos, liver and onions. The server was exceptionally nice, and we got the impression that if they had it, and we wanted it, they could make it: on or off menu. While at first that is pretty daunting to choose from, when we go back I'll know I can get something on a plate as long as they had it in the store. Whoever our cook was knew what they were doing too. My wife ordered eggs ""slightly less than over-medium."" She got exactly that, and I was impressed that they weren't over or under cooked. I know that seems kinda trivial, but head to a Denny's or IHOP and ask for eggs like that and you'll be disappointed.

One complaint: it is way too noisy in that room. There were only two of us so we didn't have too much trouble hearing each other- if we had a party of 4 or 6 I would have had a problem hearing people a couple of seats away.  I found the sound level to be stressful.

The food was very disappointing.  I wanted to order the filet mignon but they had just run out if it (at 7:00 pm on a Saturday night).  I opted for a chicken dish instead that was overly flavored with capers and a bit dry.  Others in my group ordered the salmon, lamb, scallops and a vegetarian selection.  No one raved about their meal.  

The scallop dish arrived with 6 or 7 quarter sized scallops in a cream sauce on an oversized plate.  All of us laughed out loud when it hit the table.  It looked more like an appetizer than a main course costing $17.99. The vegetarian strudel was a lump of chopped spinach wrapped in philo dough and according to my wife was a far cry from the delicious description on the menu.

I felt I owed it to the rest of Edmonton. In fact, I added this business to Yelp just so that I could write the review it deserves.  If I could give it a negative stars rating I would. I was looking forward to a nice dinner and the Ale Yard did not deliver. The service was fine; not good but not terrible and the waitresses were pleasant enough. Please save your time, money, and taste buds, because this place makes promises it does not keep. The menu boasts items richly flavoured with beer and for the prices listed, I certainly expected some tasty, high quality, beer-flavoured dishes. I did not get that. The food was bland bland bland from the appetizers to the main courses. It was so disappointing, we did not even bother to order desert. It seemed like the person cooking the food had not read the menu or recipe, or just forgot to add flavour. The food was edible, but nothing special and to echo the other reviews, completely overpriced. I am no whiz in the kitchen, but I am very confident that even I could conjure up more flavourful dishes than the Ale Yard.

Yukon Gold Chips - So  so salty and their version of Ketchup is gross. 

Potted Beer & Cheddar Chowder - I think they forgot the beer and the cheddar. This was a bland, over-priced bowl of creamy vegetable soup at $7.25.

Perfect Pour Caesar - Salad was under dressed, Caesar dressing was uninspiring and again, someone forgot to add the beer.

Barley Risotto - Probably the best of all the dishes. It was fine, but nothing special. Once again, bland and overpriced.

Maybe if I was incredibly intoxicated I would have enjoyed the food. In fact, I think you probably need to be loaded to think the food was anything special. We will never be going back to this overpriced, bland establishment. If you must go, eat before you go, and enjoy the beer. Or better yet, just go to Brewsters.

There was a beer company doing sampling and the sampling girl was supplying us with drinks because the server could not be bothered to come by the table. This was a year ago so I thought I would try it again. The second trip provided me with a little more hope as the service was better.

They do have some interesting beers on the menu, but nothing that you couldn't find anywhere else. On the weekends, they blare the music as if it's a dance bar so it's nearly impossible to have a conversation with the people sitting at your table. 

As for the food, go elsewhere. Went there for a quick lunch today and was very disappointed. They took out the entree section of the menu for today because they were ""getting ready for St. Patrick's day"", which left either a burger, salad, or some greasy appetizers as options. I opted for the portobello burger (the only vegetarian option) and was very disappointed. The bun was stale, they forgot the fried onions that were supposed to be on it, and it basically just didn't taste good. Not one of the people I was with liked their food very much. On a previous visit, I ordered the ""mini grilled cheese sandwiches"" from the appetizer section, and was again very disappointed. White bread. Processed cheese. And they still charge $11 for it.

Two seems rather low though, considering the cozy, inviting décor and the extreme friendliness of the staff.  I think two and a half would be more appropriate.  

We arrived to a mostly empty restaurant at around noon on a Saturday.  A friendly gentleman (the owner?) seated us by the fireplace, which was lovely as we had just walked through freezing winds to get there.  The prix fixe brunch is $14.99 and includes coffee and orange juice, a starter course consisting of fruit with mint yogurt dressing and a homemade muffin and finally, a choice of about eight or so main dishes.  

The fruit salad was mostly melons with a couple strawberry halves.  My first bite of melon was slightly prickly, but I decided to try another piece in hopes that my first was a fluke.  Unfortunately, I was met with the same results.  Moving on to the (apple chocolate chip) muffin, I took a couple bites and decided to save my calories.  Except for the very center, the muffin was extremely dry.  

I was hopeful that the main course would somehow rectify the situation and make our freezing trek through the Collingswood tundra worthwhile.  My chicken crepes arrived as did my dining companion's quiche du jour, which contained lobster, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.  Both dishes looked promising but fell flat in taste.  I did enjoy the consistency of the crepe itself, which was perfect, but the tiny cubes of chicken inside left much to be desired and the overall taste was very bland.  The most noticeable flavor was the red sauce ladled on top of the crepes, which completely took over the rest of the ingredients.

I think they have some of the best fajitas I've had. The pan comes out to the table sizzling loudly. The steak had been marinated in a fairly bold, tasty lime marinade accompanied by onions, peppers, with a plate of shredded cheese and the usual tortillas, etc.. The flavor of the steak is delicious (I see you've guessed I'm a red meat man). 

This restaurant also makes a grrrreat bowl (or cup) of chili. A rather spicy, smoky flavored chili. If you like a low grade, smoldering burn, don't miss it. 

Traditional Mexican favorites like tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc., are also available and are quite tasty. Seems they had an ""all you can eat"" night. I was lucky to finish what was on the plate to begin with.

Dressing was tad on the sour side, but it was a good portion.  Chicken looked gray on the sides a little.  I knew it was from being grilled, but still, it's weird seeing gray food.  Cashews was a nice flavor addition.  And oh, it said it had oranges in it, but I had maybe one tiny piece of orange in my entire salad.

BUT...........it's like this...

You know, I thought, that on the food alone, this place could easily get 5 Stars. Easy. But no, part of the entire dining experience includes service. Making sure your food is good is only half the battle.

Two stars is pretty harsh I know, but I won't rate them unless I tell you why, so the following are reasons why i rated them the way i did:

1.The server, or the food runner/busser didn't ONCE fill any of our waters (see included photo) - Big, BIG no no.

2. Where is our bread? All of the tables around us had bread,.. Was it not included? Why did the server not offer us any? i started gettting annoyed when tables all around us were getting bread refills. wtf man.

3. PREBUS!!! After I finished my delcious meal, my empty plate sat there for what seems like eons. I was seriosuly getting tired of staring at my thai chicken pasta remnants. And you know, the staff had plenty, plenty of opportunities to come by and take my plate away, but no one stopped until we were all done. See photo of all our empty plates. I ain't lyin,

4. Why did it take 20 minutes to process our payment? Despite the not-so-great service, we probably would have left a decent tip. But as the time went by, it kept spiraling down until it was almost nothing - and people know, i tip well when i can see that people are trying... this girl DID NOT seem like she was trying.

So you see, I think that the servers and staff are a representation of the restaurant as a whole... and that's why this place recieved two stars. 

Since the food was incredibly tasty I'll probably be back... But this star rating ain't changin' until they're able to redeem themselves on another visit.

Bottom line: The Food, GREAT. The Service, WTF!",2006-07-02 03:47:02

A good Thai restaurant should be a full sensory explosion of Thai-ness, and Thai Bu Ree doesn't disappoint. I am greatly suspicious of minimalist-looking Thai restaurants, are they trying to fool people into thinking they are Japanese? The walls here are hung with beautiful wood carvings, and the unobtrusive background music is always traditional.

Next up: the food. The food is a little of a mixed bag. The things they do well, they do *very* well, but the things they don't do well are really disappointing. For example, skip their Pad See Ew, trust me. The potato noodles also don't taste nearly as good as they sound.

Oh, but the curries... They make a mean curry. In fact, they make at least half a dozen mean curries. And the really cool part is that they all taste different, it's not just the same sauce rehashed over and over with different meats and veggies. I don't know where they get fresh Thai basil in the depths of winter, but any of their dishes that are heavy on the basil are just rays of sunshine on a gloomy day.

Their menu had alot of time and effort put into it.. with this rustic type of stationary and hand writing like a photo album!  Thai people are very friendly, hospitable people as per their culture. The menu and service reflect this.  What I like is that they have young, friendly, very professional, non-thai multicultural staff that seat you and attend to you.  The menu has very colorful, sometimes humorous descriptions of the cuisine they offer.  The food is tasty.  Its not dirt cheap but it is delicious and the portions are decent size.  The tom yum soup and noodles is great on a cold night!

Recommendations include the sweet potato as an appetizer and peraps garlic pork bbq ribs.  Can't go wrong with pad thai or a thai ice tea or coffee.  Dessert must is the sticky rice and mango in the summer season.  SOOO good.  The alternative sticky rice and thai custard is acceptable in the winter.  Fish is spicy and blends well with the servings of rice.  The interior is clean, well kept.

Rocks...infamous for their service and lousy portions. The only reason I kept going back there was because of the ambiance  - great people watching and convenient location. Half way through drinks or dinner, I would feel overwhelmingly disappointed and hated myself for returning. Memories of either horrible service or over-priced food would consume the rest of my experience at Rocks. So this is it...Rocks is off my list in SB...unless I see 5 stars here consistently in the next 50 reviews. 

However, if you must go there, my advice is that you should expect little and know that you are paying high price of what seems to be a hip spot in SB. If I was a tourist, I might be fine with it because the food is not bad, just small and overpriced. As for the service, you might get lucky with a good waiter but don't be surprised if you are not treated well. Perhaps the best thing to do at Rocks is just to get a drink or two, get out and then go shopping.

The service here was excellent. As we entered, besides noticing that it was an excellent place to have a family meal, we also noticed that it was extremely cold. After having a table assigned, we asked our waitress to give us a patio table and she was absolutely helpful and nice about it. Our new waitress in the patio bar area was very sociable and enthusiastic, you could tell she was having an amazing time with customers. She explained the Friday night appetizer specials, which were HALF off, and she even warned us about the pollen falling from the nearby tree in case any of us had allergies. The service was as fast as you would expect for a sit down grill type restaurant. I must add, however, that some people around us were looking for extra stools to sit on and someone was complaining that they were a bit old and squeaky, but in my opinion, they gave the restaurant a flair of originality because it matched perfectly with the rest of the southwestern flair decor. 

Now, lets talk food! I ordered an absolutely delicious appetizer of avocado egg rolls with a savory sesame/honey sauce. They were the topic of conversation the day after as we were still in awe of their exceptional crunchiness (without the greasy look that accompanies many commercial chain eggrolls) and their creamy interior. My friends and I have decided that we will attempt to make them at home. Yes, they were this good. I also ordered a portabella mushroom wrap but did not like it much because it was bland and had too much lettuce and not enough mushroom. The side was not better, bland green beans with almonds. Apparently my friend did not enjoy her pasta much either because she complained it ""lacked flavor"". My other friend did like her chicken breast with ancho/pineapple glace. In fact, she got a deal since they actually gave her two chicken breasts!

I will definitely come back here to order their avocado egg rolls! These, along with the great service made my night! Tucson's is a cute place to go with your family for great service and good southwestern food.

To be fair, it really isn't a ""restaurant"" but a take-out/delivery place, but they do have some seating and tables so you can eat there.

After looking at the posted menu, I decided to try a regular donair and a poutine.

It wasn't that busy, so I sat down and watched some hockey on the big screen they have there.  5 minutes......10 minutes.......15 minutes........I watched almost a full period of hockey before my food was served, and like I said they weren't that busy.

The young tard behind the counter then grabbed a plastic fork by the pronged end and handed it to me!  Not very sanitary, methinks.  And then I had to ask him for napkins(good luck eating a donair without them.)

I put my tray down and commenced eating.

Remember when you were a little kid eating at McDs or Dairy Queen?  The table they had their was so high and the stool I sat on was so short that the table edge was at my upper chest!  And I'm 6 feet tall. Try eating something in that way sometime.....it's very uncomfortable.

I dug into the donair first.  The filler was about standard, but the pita shell was stale and doughy, which took a lot of chewing.

After the arduous task of finishing off the donair, I took on the poutine(after wiping down my contaminated fork).

It was made of frozen crinkle cut fries you see in the supermarket.  The fat girl cook in the back didn't burn them, but they were way overcooked and hard.  In fact, the plastic prongs on my fork bent when trying to grab them!  I had to eat my poutine as a soup.

So to sum up here's what your money will get you at Richard's on 50th:

-long wait times for food
-horrible service by incompetent employees
-very uncomfortable dining
-garbage quality food

We had a yummy supper at Tucson's Southwest Grill near our accommodations. (I ll review that later)  We started with southwest egg rolls, they were quite tasty & different from other versions we've had.  Containing seasoned sausage & corn nibblets.  My SO opted for grilled MahiMahi that was done with texmex spices & he loved it!  I had grilled shrimp in an ever so tasty smoky barbecue sauce (their own creation according to the waiter)
the accompanying coleslaw was a large portion, typically there is a tiny paper cup of this stuff, but Tucson's gives a hearty scoop.  This was their own version too as it had bits of purple cabbage & limited amounts of mayonnaise letting the veggies stand out.
BYW my shrimp were a generous portion (2 skewers) enough to take back for next days lunch (yipee!).  House cut, skin on, seasoned potato fries completed the repast.
Sadly there was no room for dessert!  My husband said his coffee was perfect but I opted for water that came with a lemon wedge.
(2 packets of splenda & squeezing the lemon into the water make a passable low cal lemonade, if you want to save on a second drink,
my personal tip!)  Fellow diners seemed to enjoy a roaring hot frajita meal that arrived tableside in smokey glory.  
The atmosphere is definately child friendly & the decor is pleasant southwest shtick with cacti murals & rustic wood framed booths.
The red chili string lights were a comic accent.  There is a lovely outside deck, patio that would be great fun I imagine on warm nights.

It was one of the first places we came to, walking from our hotel. It was a glorious day out so, even though the outdoor patio was ""full"" (there were still tables empty), they found a spot for us right near the entrance. We thought this was awful kind of them, then thought differently when, 15 minutes later a keyboardist and singer set up shop right on top of us. Fortunately the musicians were pretty good, we didn't mind too bad -- but the hostess could have at least mentioned that our table came with conditional company.

Our server, a young guy with a frat-boy look to him, was cool. He provided an acceptable measure of attentiveness, although not especially knowledgeable about the menu.

We ordered drinks. I was feeling kind crazy, had a champagne/cranberry juice thing. It was understandably weird, but not bad. My girlfriend ordered lemonade, and it was bland Minute Maid crap.

Our plates included: duck confit w/feta & beets; blackened salmon salad; spicy, panko-crusted chicken sandwich w/jalapeno cheese; and a pear & goat cheese salad. Everything was pretty tasty. Only major complaint was that the pear & goat cheese salad came with a pound of pine nuts. First off, they were not mentioned in the description on the menu (which could be a serious liability for people with nut allergies). Second, a sprinkle of pine nuts is nice; a heaping layer is impressive; this salad was literally drowned in pine nuts. Way overkill!

After a day spent learning about TN, I walked around downtown near the bus station looking for something to eat. I saw two restaurants next to each other, both offering kebabs and gyros. Instead of the one advertising itself as Greek, I chose the one with kebabs and gyros in its name.

Too bad I don't get a do-over.

The main reason I chose this place over the other was because I wanted fries, but didn't want any temptation to get it. I don't remember if this place offered fries; for that reason alone, I think it didn't. Otherwise, I would have ordered it. I do remember fries being offered next door.

Anyway, while the food itself was cheap, it was room temperature. I came around 1:30PM and a few customers had just ordered their gyros to go. I was the only one in the restaurant until I was done eating.

The tables were in serious need of cleaning. I usually don't pay attention if a fork I'm about to use was first placed on the table, but this time I made sure that a napkin was underneath it. If a lunch rush had just happened, I can understand if the tables hadn't been cleaned, yet. But the stains looked old.

The tzaziki sauce didn't seem to have any noticeable cucumbers in it, but I really wasn't expecting authenticity. I knew it was a dive when I came in.

We came in with mixed thoughts about this establishment. In the end we left pretty pleased.

-- The Pros --

We ordered Grilled Beef with Spring Roll noodle bowls, extra fish sauce and peanut sauce. My guest ordere a Raspberry bubble tea. The food came out at a timely pace and was well presented. The staff were pleasant and friendly and the atmosphere very quiet which for a place like this is how I prefer it.

The overall taste was wonderful. Not too strong with the fish sauce and not too sweet. The peanut sauce had great flavor for the amount we received. We had tea which had lots of flavor and the portioning was perfect. 

The bubble tea was made usig fresh ingredients and well blended.

-- The Cons --

My guest loves the spice. She had ordered hers with extra spice and in the ended needed more spice. The temperature was adequate but could have been hotter but was still satisfactory for flavor and health.

-- Recommemdations --

Would be nice if this place had subtle music for ambience and precut the spring rolls if addig to a bowl of rice vermicelli.

Today, I ordered a chicken platter that was listed on the menu as $6.99. All that I had was that and a cup of water - nothing else. The guy rang me up for $8 even. He said that the difference was ""tax."" While I know that Nashville's sales tax is relatively high, I didn't think it would be more than $1. Also, the receipt he gave me showed no breakdown of the charges, which is unusual. After paying for my meal, I checked the menu to confirm the price, then I sat down with my phone to calculate the sales tax. At 9.25%, I only should have paid $7.64. I went back up to the guy and asked him questions. First question was whether he charged me for the cup of water. He said no. Next question was what percent tax he charged. (I was thinking maybe it was different for food serving establishments.) Instead of answering my question, though, he just opened his cash register, gave me a quarter, and said, ""It's okay."" 

First off, with a refund of only 25 cents, I was still overcharged. Second, his response was highly unprofessional and only further shows ill intent. A more professional cashier would have gone through the calculations with me and either (1) gotten me to see why the difference was $1.01, or (2) said, ""Oh, you're right"" and refunded me the appropriate amount. 

Instead, though, he just gave me a quarter to get me to shut up. I think that's his protocol - dupe the unsuspecting customers who don't have my number sense, and if they try to argue, just give them a quarter. Imagine how much they reap from this tactic!

And yes, I later did my homework on this. I Google-searched the percent tax for establishments such as these, and I pulled out my receipt from Subway the other day (just a few blocks away). It is still 9.25%.

I decided on the Chicken Burrito with green enchilada sauce.  It was very tasty.  You could taste the heat just a bit, but my no means was it spicy hot.  It was packed full of shredded chicken.  I sat at the bar and was checked on several times by the waitress and the owner.  It was obvious that most of those in the shop were regulars and that is who they cater to.

I thought the price was reasonable for what you got (my experience is that downtown tends to up price for the privilege of being downtown).  I would have liked a side of rice and or beans.  I saw that it was listed under a Side order heading and I would probably do that next time.

I am not bar hopper, so I asked what sodas they had, and she started rattling off the list.  She barely got started when she said RC.  I stopped her because it is my favorite but not common in Tucson.

The menu is quite standard for American style Italian dishes, but you also get the unique atmosphere and always splendid, friendly service. I don't know what it is about this place, but I love it. Spaghetti Warehouse is so cozy and comfortable, and the menu is straight-up comfort food. It's a no fuss, no frills type restaurant. Don't come here if you are looking for gourmet Italian or fancy stuff you can't make at home, because you won't find it. It's all about enjoying a big plate of spaghetti with friends or a loved one, and just having good conversation and an all-around good time out. The decor is rather disjointed, but creative and gaudy all at the same time. Where else can you sit and eat inside a full size trolley car? Here you can, and it's our favorite spot for a table when we come here. The atmosphere is open and airy, probably because this place is literally a converted old warehouse; with high ceilings and exposed brick, large wrought-iron windows and mementos of the ""old days."" In the lobby, there is a 20's style train ticket booth, an old style barber's chair, and off to the side, a classic hardwood phone booth, with a working phone inside! The flooring in the lobby reminds me of a train platform as well. In the big open dining room, we have a large brass gazebo, the aforementioned trolley car smack in the middle, and plastered all over the walls one will find old-school advertising signage and memorabilia. All of these factors make this place a one-of-a-kind experience. Like I said, the menu is standard but they give you many choices, all prepared well. You go in thinking the service could possibly be shaky, but it always ends up being top notch and the servers are all very friendly and personable. This is a restaurant with a sure identity, never trying to be something it's not (like Olive Garden pretending to be real or even gourmet/fancy Italian). Truly a diamond in the rough of Philly.",2008-12-12 15:40:35

They do have free parking for customers but their parking lot only has a limited number of parking spaces. My initial impression of the restaurant is the decor is unusual. You'll see a barber chair as you enter the restaurant. Why? Is that for the spaghetti and a haircut special? Dinner and a shave? The rest of the restaurant looks like an old-fashioned train station. They have a party room that can accommodate maybe up to a hundred people, which is good if you're planning an event.

One thing to note is the menu on the Spaghetti Warehouse website is not all there is. On Wednesday, they have a ""create your own spaghetti"" special with a lower base price. You get bread, spaghetti with sauce, and soup or salad in the base price, and you can add meatballs, sausage, grilled vegetables, etc, at extra cost. 

As for the food, it is nothing spectacular, as many reviewers have noted. Rather mediocre, actually. It's not disgusting or gross, but it still would be disappointing if you were expecting something special. The portions are decently sized. It's not my experience but some folks in our group had substantial amounts of leftovers to take home after the meal.

So as a young college student, it seemed like a good idea to hit up the Spaghetti Warehouse: Mom was passing through town and wanted to grab dinner with me somewhere close to campus.  I wanted to get off of Temple's domain, but knew we didn't have too much time, so my mind instantly gravitated toward the Spaghetti Warehouse.  It's pretty close and I knew right where it was, because it's impossible to miss. 

True to name, this place is a big open spot and has a warehouse/cheap italian restaurant feel.  you know, with plastic checkered red and white tablecloths.  I guess that could be fun.

To be honest, I don't remember a whole lot about my meal here, everything was average, and in no way memorable.  I do know one thing: I haven't had the slightest desire to go back here in the last four years.  It's a big chain restaurant that somehow maintains business.  I save seen there banner advertising a $5 lunch special, if you really feel the need to visit, lunch is the time to do so.

In town for business, I ate a late lunch at Bluepoint on my last day in Tucson to celebrate a long and productive work week.

This is one swanky joint. Long windows that went  from the floor to the ceiling (which must have been at least 15-ft. high) run the southern wall of the restaurant, giving an unobstructed view of the city below. Cozy circular banquettes in creamy beige sit in the middle and northern end of the restaurant, while 4-top tables line the windows. There is a gorgeous and huge circular bar - a great place to meet friends after work for apres-dinner drinks. Patio seating is also available.

At 2:15 p.m. on a weekday, I was one of only several parties in the restaurant. But my waiter was quite gracious and never rushed me. He brought me warm bread with herb butter as I perused the menu and sipped a Mai Tai, which was excellent. 

One can order 4-5 kinds of fish in several ways: grilled, sauteed, or blackened. I ordered blackened Mahi-mahi with rice and broccoli. One can also order a sauce to top the fish, such as ginger soy butter sauce, mango salsa, or creole sauce with baby gulf shrimp.

I'm sure the sauces are delicious, but my Mahi-mahi was perfect the way it came: tender inside and spicy with a bit of crunch outside. I squeezed a bit of lemon to heighten the flavors, but that was about it. Portion sizes are generous but not gargantuan, thank God. The broccoli was nicely steamed so it was still crisp when I bit into it. Besides fish, you can also order steaks, salads (with your choice of chicken, shrimp or salmon) sandwiches, and oysters (both raw and Rockefeller).

I understand that Bluepoint has a very good happy hour, although I wasn't there to experience it, alas. The rest of the staff I encountered - the barkeep and the host/manager - were, as my waiter, quite nice without being obsequious.

All in all, Bluepoint is perfect for a ""date"" dinner with your significant other, a celebratory meal with friends/family, and probably also happy hour with friends when you want to be someplace with polish and style.",2008-05-30 18:27:16

I'm sure during the cooler times in Tucson the patio is a wonderful place to hang out.

Our server was attentive to the point of getting our order and then he was a bit AWOL. Actually, we had to signal to the manager to get our water glasses refilled after finishing the wine. So that is the only reason I'm not giving a 5 star review.

Specific Information:        
I walked into Jaritza's not knowing what to expect, except for the fact that it was Spanish food. There wasn't any parking in front of it so I had to park at the laundromat across the street, which people do all the time. When I went to order I didn't see a menu, which made me a little nervous but, I  asked the woman behind the counter what was a good chicken meal. She was very friendly and helpful in helping me pick out a meal. She gave me three choices that all sounded delicious. She then asked what kind of rice I wanted with it and when I say it was a lot of rice, it was A LOT of rice. 

Food Quality:
The meal I got was peppered chicken, rice and beans, and mixed vegetables. The chicken tasted very fresh and was full of flavor! The vegetables were perfectly cooked and had a fabulous garlic like seasoning on it. She gave me a whole container of them for $4. I spent $10 and got three separate meals out of it. Jaritza's definitely gives you, your money worth of food! It was the best Spanish meal I have ever had and would without a doubt go back and try something different. There were also fresh smoothies that you could order that looked delicious. Next time I plan on trying one of them! 

Recommend:
I would definitely recommend this restaurant. But, make sure you bring cash if you plan to spend under $10. It is a minimum of $10 to use a credit card. Unfortuantely, I did not know this until I went to pay but the waitress helped me pick out something else that would get me to my $10 minimum

Pros:
Waitress was very friendly and helpful when choosing my meal after I explained to her that I had never been there. 

Cons:
Hard to find parking and there was no menu. Everything that did have signs was in Spanish but, the waitress did speak English. 

Overall Rating:
I give Jaritza's a 9 out of 10! Next time I plan on taking more people with me so that they can get a taste of an authentic Spanish meal that's right around the corner and would also help support our local businesses!",2018-03-07 22:55:52

The food itself is definitely not even on the average level.  The wonton's in the wonton soup tasted like they were from yesterday.  The egg roll wasn't crispy.  Everything was pretty bland.  Some items I got were even cold.  The saving grace of the trip was the hibachi station where the chef behind the counter will cook whatever concoction you want right in front of you.  I mixed some shrimp, noodles and veggies with their spicy hibachi sauce.  It was pretty good.

The menu has a VERY extensive history of the evolution of this place into its current form and makes for an interesting read.  The ladies working here were very friendly and gave great service.  They also have some awesome daily specials and I was sorely tempted by their seafood lasagna special but I had to try the roast beef po boy on this visit.  

I decided to sample their tamales for an appetizer and cautiously ordered the large 18 inch roast beef po boy with the expectation I would have some left over.  The tamales were decent but tasted like most other tamales I've had.  The roast beef po boy was imposing when I first unwrapped it and the French bread was perfectly toasted.  The roast beef itself was good but there wasn't a great deal of it on the sandwich and there also wasn't a lot of gravy.  The meat was adequately juicy but it just had a hint of gravy flavor that I wanted more of.  The thin layer of meat enabled me to easily finish the entire 18 inches of the sandwich with no problem.  As a point of comparison eating the ""smaller"" whole roast beef at R&O's leaves me far more full as there is a greater quantity of meat and the flavor of that po boy still leaves R&O's as my top choice for a roast beef po boy.  St. Rose Tavern definitely makes a good roast beef and I will certainly return to this charming spot to sample more of their menu.",2013-03-04 15:15:19

I had the yellow rice with gandules, not the best I've ever had, but good. Then some mangu with onions as my side (these are mashed green plantains, comparable to a dryer, lumpy mashed potato). My hubby got the roasted chicken, with salad and yellow rice. Both plates came with a bottle of water as well!

We also added empanadas to our meals - because we are fatties - and the meat was very well seasoned and perfectly crunchy.

The salads were just iceberg lettuce with one slice of tomato, one ring of onion and a couple croutons.  On to the entrees...I had the veggie lasagna, and my boy had the fettuccine alfredo.  the lasagna reminded me of frozen lasagna.  my boy said the alfredo in a box is better than what he had.

Type of Food: Spanish Cuisine
Time/ Date: 6:00 pm; Dinner; 2/27/2017

Pros: Great food selection,  a lot of options on the menu, good service
Cons: Not enough space in the restaurant

Specific Information:
On a Monday evening I stopped at Jaritza's Restaurant on Federal Street for a bite to eat with a few classmates. We walked in and we were greeted right away. The staff waited patiently as we checked out the menu. They had many options in the Spanish cuisine genre. I ordered the sweet bananas which were absolutely delicious and they only cost two dollars for a good amount. The picture below doesn't do it justice because I ate most of it before I could take a picture. They were so good and I was so anxious I didn't even realize my actions until I was half way done. I finally snapped a pic to remember the moment before it was too late.  I also got some yellow rice and beans. I was going for the sweet and salty combination and it absolutely got the job done. You can never go wrong with some rice and beans. It's a classic dish. All of my food was gone within minutes. As well as my classmates who as well got the rice and beans and pepper steak on the side. We all left very satisfied.

Customer Service: From the moment I walked through the door, I was greeted with a warm welcome. I like going to restaurants where you are not rushed to find what you would like to eat. They also offered some ideas to help narrow down the many options they have included in the menu. Everything was handled with care and smiles all throughout the order. There wasn't a long wait for the food; we received our meals within minutes. I would say customer service was a 5 out 5. 

Would you recommend the restaurant?:
I would definitely recommend Jaritza's Restaurant. The food is tasty, your food is served in a timely manner, and the staff is friendly. They make sure you have everything you need. Jaritza's Restaurant is a good place to stop by and get a quick, filling, bite to eat for a good price. They have so many options so I guarantee you'll have something new to try every time. Next time I'll try their smoothies. 

Overall Rating: I rate this restaurant 4 out of 5

o A typical breakfast menu from a hotel.

The Poor:
- The service. Indifferent, slow, apathetic. 
- The food. Low quality and poorly presented. On top of that my fruit was nearly rotten. Terrible. I'd say the food is on par with what you'd find for ""free"" at many other national chains (bagel, english muffin, yogurt, pancakes, etc.).
- Expensive. Their margin on this terrible food must be very high.

You've been warned: skip this place for breakfast.",2015-01-01 19:25:20

But really, it's YOUR FAULT! The pizza egg rolls should tip you off that everythings not quite right in this bizarro Italian eatery that is decorated with it's very own trolley car (just like all the best places in Naples). 

But you know what? I've found myself here a few times always under duress and drinking heavily. And when I looked around everybody at the bar was doing the same but unlike the rest of Philadelphia where everybody looks at you like you're a rotten jar of mayonnaise, everybody at this place was really nice. 

It seems like a nice place for friendly people of all races and creeds: Black, White, Italian... whatever the case may be. To get together and eat spaghetti.

The place definitely has a  much cooler vibe than a big chain like applebees or tgi fridays. So once you understand that the food is more like a metaphor for life than something you want to reheat, you'll have a great time!

First, the service was terrible. We were delivered and finished our appetizers before our drinks were delivered. The waitress dropped multiple things at the table and had issues taking our order.

When the food was delivered, one meal was overcooked, one was undercooked, and the rest were extremely mediocre. Things simply weren't seasoned properly and didn't seem fresh. One of the diners also got food poisoning from the meal and was sick for 3 days.

When the manager came around to ask how our meal was, there was an awkward pause from the table. To the credit of the manager, he did comp the appetizers and the overcooked meal.

But, this place was a less than ideal experience. And painful for one of our group. Skip this place and find somewhere else to eat, even if you have to take a taxi or order delivery.",2013-11-10 14:29:12

Interesting old trolley car in center seats 10+ tables, fourposter gold bedframes ring a center VIP area - along the Spring Garden side windows present decent urbanesques extending the tiered, satisfying experience.

The food - the sauce - is fine - above average!

IS the pasta freshly made daily - can u tell the diff??

Simplicity! Complicity!
Pasta with grilled veges, ravioli, etc - mmmmm

Eggplant parm is too bready - the portion on that one range to obscenity.. but not vulgarity!

The Location is perfect. I had lunch with a friend and sat on the patio outside, as it was a beautiful day out. The views and people watching are great. It was clean and quiet. We started out with the chicken nachos as an appetizer. It took a little longer than I expected to get the appetizer, and then the entrees came out shortly after, while we were still working on the chicken nachos. I ordered the crab cake entree, substituting the fries for mac n cheese and my friend had the fish and chips. 

The portions were very large, so despite the fact that the prices may be more than other places in town, you definitely get your money's worth. I didn't care for the cole slaw that came with the crab cakes, but the crab cakes (3) and mac n cheese were fantastic. We ended the meal with the vanilla creme brulee, which was also large enough to be shared. The waitress was great, albeit a little crass for a Foothills establishment, but I'm young so she didn't offend me at all.

This is the first time that we visited LOS MEZQUITES, we weren't expecting it to be so busy! The breakfast buffet was beyond our expectations! 
 
The delicious birria, the amazing potatoes with chorizo, the beans with cheese, tortillas, menudo, fresh fruit, pancakes...Gosh! everything was sooo good! And all for just 9 dollars! Me and my husband ate so much we ended up with ""Food Coma"" we could barely walk out and felt it was one of the best breakfasts ever!  We will definitely be back! 
 
Things to consider before you go: After 9 am is CROWDED!, inside seating is a bit warm, outside is a bit fresher, but not as many seats. I am not sure how that would work during the summer, but we will post more.

This is not a fancy place, think of it as a ""True Mexican Experience"", the bathroom is a porta-potty outside.

The tomato sauce has meat juice in it and comes standard as a dip or on your pasta so make sure you order the marinara if you're veggie.  This is information I have pried out of servers over the years.  I'm like the old wise vegetarian Spaghetti Warehouse patron, so sad.  

Anyway what's good about the place besides the nostalgia and the photo booth is the bread and salad.  The bread is a hot loaf of sourdough served with the nectar of the gods in the form of garlic butter.  So good.  Maybe it has crack in it and that's why I still make the annual guilty pleasure trek to 10th and Spring Garden.   

The desserts are also suprisingly bangin' but I am pretty sure they're just defrosted and not made on premises.  I am in lust with both the tiramisu and the turtle cheesecake.   

This is not a fancy place but when you're 18 and you work at a bagel place and live in Fairmount it's pretty amazing.  You will probably have a stomach ache afterwards though.  Just look at your photos from the evening and it will make it better.  I promise.",2009-12-29 06:47:24

The nachos grande were drizzled with a heavenly green sauce we thought would be guacamole, but was a bit thin.

Anyway, I'll give it an initial 3 stars. The mussels aren't so hot. I love mussels, they are one of my favorite foods, and in my opinion warrant their own spot on the pyramid. So I have eaten them off every menu in town just about, and good ones are hard to find, so the 'meh' mussels are forgivable. 

The cassoulet on the other hand is magnificent, a great blend of sausage, chicken and prosciutto with a great garlic butter sauce that is out of this world. The service seems hot or miss but is never offensively bad.

Oh, and this place is certainly going on my favorite patios list.",2008-08-22 18:16:20

I've always had a soft spot in my heart (and on my palate) for the California Café.  The food has always been creative and they have always tried to maintain great customer relations, by developing and maintaining a following of loyal diners and wine lovers.  That's why we jumped at the chance to attend their most recent soirée, The Merryvale Wine Stroll, held on Friday night, August 13, 2010. ($25 per person, including tax and gratuity) 

Merryvale Winery was the first winery built in Napa Valley after the repeal of Prohibition, and it is a stunning site in St. Helena, CA.  They produce a number of quality wines, so I was eager to sample their offerings at this gathering.  We assembled the usual suspects for our journey, including Mr. Rick and Ms. Denise, who have accompanied us through many a wine tasting trip (and sometimes a stumble and fall!), our mutual friends, Laura and Bruce, and of course, my frequent dining companion.  

The menu consisted of the following food and wine stations:
1. Kumamoto Oyster (wasabi tobico, pickled ginger mignonette) paired with Starmont Sauvignon Blanc; 2. Arugula and Peach Salad (toasted hazelnuts, white balsamic vinaigrette) paired with Starmont Chardonnay; 3. Duck Confit Phyllo Cups (cherry vanilla chutney, fresh mint) paired with Starmont Cabernet Sauvignon; 4. Moody Blue Filet Tip Skewers (caramelized red onion, sweet balsamic drizzle) paired with Starmont Merlot; 5. Mini Crème Brulee and Chocolate Covered Grand Marnier Strawberries paired with Antigua Dessert Wine.

Immediately upon entering, we gazed around the main dining room, noticing that the back dining room, the bar area, and the front section were reserved for regular dinner guests.  We also noticed that although there were some tables for four, larger parties were confined to a booth.  A booth is nice for dining, as it affords a degree of privacy and allows for quiet conversation.  However, when entering and exiting frequently, a booth is the worst.  Laura suggested that they consider renting some high-top tables (tables of 36"" to 42"" in height, where people normally stand), next time.  What happened was that many migrated to the bar and sat there with their wine, making it difficult for the bartender to serve others not participating in the wine stroll.

From the start, things did not go well for the staff.  The oyster/Sauv Blanc pairing although excellent, was not planned well.  The unwritten rule was, that you could go back to any station and continue to sample the wine and food.  Unfortunately, at the oyster station, folks were loading six to eight oysters on their plates, thus depriving others in line of sampling the succulent mollusk.  That led to a game of catch-up for the staff, as they had to shuck each oyster by hand, creating a bottleneck.  The bright spot to this fiasco was Chef Rachel, who worked the floor, immediately identified the problem, and had her kitchen prepare some shrimp on a skewer to help diffuse the situation.

As the night wore on, and Chef Rachel worked her magic at the various stations, substituting for what had run out, I reflected on the evening.  I would have liked to have spoken with her that night, and the invitation said she would be available throughout the evening to talk with her guests, but I could see she was very busy maintaining her high standards of service.  I really wanted to dislike this tasting.  I wanted to strike back at them for making me miss all but a couple of oysters, but as I looked around the room, all I saw were smiles.  It was infectious.  People had given up on the booths, and were standing and chatting with strangers in the booths next to them, and the laughter was unmistakable.",2010-08-21 14:22:29

Service - Dining room was empty so we get quick, attentive service.
Decor - This place used to be Casa Sanchez...it still looks and feels the same (fast food)

Food - Terrible...bland and tasteless (except the rice). My wife had the ground beef tacos. They were nasty....basically fried beef with no seasoning what so ever. The kind of tacos you expect from ""Taco Nite"" at the nursing home. I ordered the Chili Renenos...which were better then the tacos, but they were cooked in a very weird way. They took the stuffed green chili, dipped it in a ton of eggs and cooked it. In the end, it looked like and tasted like a omelet with green chili and cheese.

The only good thing on each plate was the rice. A nice change from the usual bland rice with tomato paste that most Mexican places serve. The rice was fluffy and tasty.
I hope the owners read this and makes some changes. We need a good cheap mexican restaurant in this area. So I say to the owners, dont worry about decor, focus on the food, cook authentic, tasty Mexican food and people will come.",2010-01-11 23:14:01

I am looking for nice in a wait person, not looking for a friend, just someone thinking about me and my meal for the next hour.

Had the penne with sausage and chicken as an entre, hey this tastes okay!

In the past I have had mostly appetizers and they are always great. Try the fried green beans. This time I had the Spicy Black Bean Veggie Wrap. It was really good!

When they say Pacific, they are referring to the Pacific Rim, not the West Coast Pacific Ocean (a la California).  There is a definite Asian theme to the restaurant.  

For an appetizer, the waitress suggested the lobster and crab egg rolls.  No doubt the meat was real (rather than the imitation stuff).  However, it had a heavy oil flavor from being deep fried.  I am not sure what I would have expected.  It seemed like a great way to mess up the ingredients.  It might have been better with a lighter oil a wrap that didn't soak the oil.  

I had the grouper special which was seasoned and cooked well.  The fish was fresh and flavorful. As a garnish they had deep fried spinach (again with the heavy oily flavor).

My friend always raved about sushi and how there was only one place in our area to get it: Lotus Oriental. So we went and I fell in love.

I've since introduced gaggles to the perfection that is Lotus. The fish is bright and plump and never masked by other filler ingredients. The soy sauce is brewed with a bit of sugar to a thicker consistency than most. Untraditional? Maybe. But it's addicting. To keep it interesting for lifers like me, they have a revolving board of 10 or so special sushi rolls.

Chinese food is tasty here, too. I don't usually eat this because I'm mesmerized by the sushi bar but I've had it enough to know it's good.

The best way to describe this place is it feels like a bar out of the 1980's. This is the case in terms of decor, clientele and the alcohol selection. I stopped by to kill some time while waiting for a train back to New Jersey as it was the only bar in the mall. Everyone in the bar seemed to be older locals and the decor was very dreary looking. It's also a pretty small place with limited seats at the bar and some tables in the back if you decide to sit down and have a meal. The alcohol selection was fairly limited with only merlot for red wine and the the absolute basics from a rum standpoint. 

I wasn't expecting to blown away by this place and i certainly wasn't. It is exactly what it is, a bar in a metro station that also serves food.

Came here for my birthday yesterday.  (Oddly) I had been struggling to figure out where to go for my bday meal.  Sure I had a couple free meal coupons, but they were for places like Qdoba and Red Robin.  I didn't feel like venturing too far out, so we ended up choosing this place.  Looking back, we probably should've driven the extra 15 minutes.

AMBIENCE- this place looks a lot bigger from the outside.  The decor kind of made me think design on a dime.  At a first glance, the place looked pretty classy.  However, upon being seated, you could tell that the owners probably didnt' spend all that much.  For example, the light covering looked to be a nice looking piece of wrapping paper, and the nice print on the ""booths"" were actually plastic.  I'm not holding that against them, just saying what I observed.

SERVICE- I was somewhat reluctant to go here because a number of people had said service was hit or miss.  Shame on me for not heeding their warning.  As we were about to be seated, a woman cut us off and asked the hostess to run their bill.  I thought this was rather rude of the woman, but after dining here, I can understand why.  Our server was barely there, and sure it was pretty busy, but the 10 minutes in between each appearance was some what annoying.  Also, she never mentioned the specials to us, which I'm sure we could've asked about, but isn't that something they should lead off with?  The hostess (who we think is the owner) was very friendly, but outside of her appearances, we were not impressed at all.

MENU- so this place serves ""Southern European"" food.  I don't know how that translates, but they seemed to have some interesting dishes.  They had appetizers such as mussels, and hummus, as well as a variety of soups and salads.  Wine selection looked decent, though I dont' drink, so I can't really say for sure.

Entrees were interesting, they had a meat and poultry section, seafood, pasta, and specialties ranging in price from $15-$30.  Their specialties are what actually peaked my interest in the first place.  They have paella ""madrid stew"", and french lasagna.  What I was really interested in though was the cassoulet.  Ever since hearing about cassoulet on the food network, I had wanted to try it.  I figured, it's my birthday, and I was going to party like it's my birthday.

FOOD- my wife elected to get their chicken and sausage pasta, while I went with the cassoulet.  They have petite and regular portions on both, and since we were hungry, we went with the regular.  

Our meal started out with bread (which you can buy and take home if you want).  The bread didn't seem to be anything extraordinary.  Along with the bread, we both got house salads.  I probably should've tried some soup, but a salad sounded good.  Too bad it was not.  It rivaled that of a side salad you would find at Denny's.

Finally the main courses arrived.  My wife's pasta was ample, though pretty Olive Garden-esque.  The cassoulet came out and it was piping hot (the server did warn me about that).  Once it cooled down enough I began.  Hmmph.  The flavor explosion that I was hoping for just wasn't there.  Add that to the fact that I'm not a huge bean fan to begin with, and it proved to be rather disappointing.  I knew beans were the main focus, but I figured as long as they were seasoned well I could overlook that.  Not the case.  I will say that both of our servings were huge, but it's a lot of average food.

OVERALL- I don't think we'll be going back.  We saw some of the other dishes, and couldn't help but keep making the Olive Garden comparisons.  If I want flavorful food, I'll go to Yats and save $20.

We had a 6:00pm reservation and arrived at 5:50pm. The hostess seated us in a tiny little two top in the very rear of the restaurant. Being that there was only 1 other table occupied in the entire place we were like WTF?? They moved us to a booth upon request. 

The service (aka waiter) was a slug, we waited 75 minutes for cold food. When we told him the food was cold he picked up the plates and did not say a word, and took our plates back. I was somewhat hopeful at this point thinking that they were remaking our dishes. No such luck the med rare steaks were nuked to beyond well done and we waited over 98 minutes to be served basically Alpo. 

I will say that the real problem here was the service, which in turn made the food bad. Had he not let the food sit and served us promptly, I think it would have been a pretty enjoyable experience. But, at the same time, does this place not have an expediter or manager? Someone had to see our plates sit there and sit there and sit there.

Fortunately the food came out pretty fast- I would hope so since it was just us- and it was okay. Had better, had worse.

We saw her again for one refill, and to bring the check but that was it. We got our own extra napkins and to-go containers off the cart towards the back-the waitress didn't act as though she could be bothered-and left without so much as a thank you, come again or kiss my a**... nothing.

Definitely had to test their worth. We came for the buffet to try out the different dishes but came at the wrong time. Don't recommend going in at 4:30. It's right before their dinner time and there weren't many selections. 
Despite this the host was friendly and let us know what was going on and that if we saw something missing that we liked we could let him know and he'd yell at the cooks to get the ball rolling. 
I always rate Chinese food by their fried rice (my all time favorite dish) so I filled my plate with that and sweet and sour pork. The gals let the host know what was missing. 
The fried rice was... Above average. I've had better but I would eat this happily. The sweet and sour pork was surprisingly tasty and could've eaten my fill with just those 2. I had some oysters tho they were cold cuz of the bad timing so that's all I can say. Tried the crab rangoon and thought it was average. 
Sadly this is all I really tried... Other than the crab legs (which came out later after we requested them and the host yelling at the cooks a 2nd time. Though it was friendly yelling :]). Had 2 plates of them and I was content.

He should've come out and waited tables, or at least someone should've bussed for her. There were only six tables in the whole place. 

Aside from all of this, the vegetarian chili I ordered was cold (I literally said ""please make sure its ridiculously hot, I don't care if you microwave it""), and the sandwiches and wraps we got (turkey & swiss, and southwestern wrap, respectively) were unimpressive. As I've said before, the only rule I have about a ""good"" sandwich is that a.) its good, and b.) its something that I can't easily make at home. Negative on both parts.

More then once I've had to wait nearly fifteen minutes in order to get my food through the drive through because the person they have operating the window has a hard time trying to get orders together, even going inside the people behind the counter just don't seem to have their act together, their texting or just hanging around the counter or yelling at the kitchen staff in either idle conversation or because they're messing up orders with no manager in sight. I came close a few times to pulling away and just not get anything from them its that annoying. Half the time my burger and onion rings were a sloppy mess and were falling apart (And its not even a long drive for me to get back to my work!), the only good thing they still have are the fries, those are good, their chicken tenders are absolutely dry, I have to use a large amount of ketchup in order to eat them. If it wasn't for the fact I know someone who works there I would never even bother with coming here. 

Overall, this comes from bad choices in management and managers hiring people who just can't be trusted handling food. I honestly don't know what happened to this location.",2015-03-29 21:01:40

High note is that there is lots of aisle space between the tables and booths. Gives a sense of personal space that's valuable with such a low ceiling. 

Sushi mostly ranged from 3-5 out of 5, but averaged a 4. One got a 1. Solid flavors and variety without going nutty.

Moving on to the buffet, I mostly saw average choices. That being said, they did have their own spin on several dishes. I pulled from pans that were low and some that were fresh.

Veggies were firmer than I usually see, meaning that they weren't overcooked. Flavor was also more pronounced than usual. Older food was as dried out as you would expect from the dredges of the pan, but still tasty. I can only imagine how good it would be fresh. Definitely good eats.

I was disappointed that the steam buns were gone, but thoroughly impressed with how they keep their soups. Stock is kept out and hot. Fillers such as the wonton for wonton soup are kept in steamers alongside the stock. Didn't try it, but I predict firm wontons there. :D

I did try the miso soup. I wonder if there was any salt to it at all. I'm pretty used to it salty by now, especially with seaweed in it. Otherwise, the flavor is still what I enjoy. Admittedly, I waited too long to eat it, so it was cold.

Great customer service. Left me alone for most of my meal, but hit all my refills and sushi clearing while I was back up there. I overlooked the soup bowls, but the gentleman cleaning the buffets went to find some for me. I wandered off and back, but he followed up when he saw me back with the new-found bowl. 

I asked for a wetnap at the end of my meal. My waitress said that they don't have any. She must have seen the hostess coming to save her from telling a customer ""no,"" because they had excellent replacement timing. Turns out that the wetnaps have a tendency to dry out, so they use hand sanitizer with a dry napkin. Works pretty well.

By the way, this is the first shopping plaza restroom that I've seen so clean. The color scheme may be aesthetically questionable, but it feels like going to someone's house. Plus they have a legit changing station with padding. Granted, I may have been seeing the post-dinner rush cleanup results, but similar situations haven't been as pleasant before.

Overseas experience has made me picky on buffets. I'd come back on a regular basis with my husband. Bowing during interactions in these settings has become Pavlovian at this point.

When the manager came and asked how everything was, I just wanted to know if they served it like that on purpose.  He said that's how corporate told them to do it.  It then clicked with my iffy feeling that this was a franchise and maybe there's a connection between the Castaways on North Ave. beach in Chicago.   I've good experiences with the Castaways in Chicago though.  I told him that I'd recommend that they make it with fresh rice instead.  He didn't like my description of the way the rice tasted, either.

For 1/2 the price, you can get triple the taste at Little Fish (now Fish)'s Sunday Tasting Menu, which will rock your socks off.

Back to Saute. While they did give each of us different courses, so a 5 course tasting really was like a 10 course tasting since we were sharing, many of the courses were .... ehhh to say the best. 

There was a capers-seafood pasta that we couldn't stomach, and without that this review probably would've been a 3 star. But the sauce tasted like raw capers stewing overnight with squid. Not tasty. 

We had marlin mini-tacos which were cute and not bad. Some other little courses here and there were ok. But that pasta really soured our night (literally) and we didn't recover the stomach to enjoy the rest of the tasting.

I was in Santa Barbara for a wedding, and Jake's is ""Just Around the Corner!"" from their apartment.  A handful of us went there on Saturday morning, around 10:30, and the place wasn't crazy crowded.  There were 6 of us, and we got seated right away.  We just had to wait 2 minutes for them to shove two tables together.

They've got a couple TVs, and the one closest to us had the Wiggles on, but since the other one had News, we caught a story we wanted to watch, and requested a channel change.  Rather than sticking us with whatever channel they chose, we simply got handed the remote, which was nice.  

The place only serves Breakfast & Lunch, but I can see why they stick to their specialties.  Before we had ordered, we got a plate of muffins that we honestly some of the best I've ever had.  They were a cranberry muffin, but the inside was soft and moist, and the outside was crispy, just we way a muffin should be.  I knew then that breakfast would be yummy.

I ordered something called ""The Charleston"".  It comes with 2 or 3 eggs (your choice based on your appetite), canadian bacon, grits (which I substituted for Hash Browns, because I hate grits), and tomato slices.  I have a thing with eggs.  I always order them over-easy because I hate runny egg whites.  The problem with this is that 95% of the time, the yolks are harder too.  I like my yolks runny.  This is the first time in I don't know how long that my eggs, when ordered Over-Easy, actually came out over-easy.   The hash browns were perfect, nice and crispy, but still soft in the interior parts.  The tomato was on the slightly not quite ripe side, but nothing to complain about.  other people at my table were raving about their breakfasts as well, and I think we all ate more than we really should have.

An air of sophistication exudes from the welcoming space and extends to the very professional service.  The well-priced menu offers something for everyone and the $35 prix-fix dinner of four courses is a good incentive for the more adventurous (or decision-challenged) diners to put themselves in the capable hands of chef Nicholas Cassidy.

Even though we finally opted for the set dinner (a table of four will receive two different dishes with each course), we could not pass up the oxtail empanada appetizer, an indulgence that was rewarded by a rich and very pleasurable dish.  

The first course of the menu brought a small selection of homemade charcuterie.  The thin slice of rabbit terrine was the clear winner of a selection that also included an equally thin slice of chicken ballotine (marred by the incomprehensible addition of truffle oil) and a house-cured pancetta that was overly salty and very hard to chew.  The barley soup with carrots was good, a well-balanced broth containing nicely cooked barley.  Main dishes included a tasty diver scallop with parsnip puree, a nicely cooked steak with barley (barley seemed to be very popular that evening), escargots, and a vegetarian empanada. Like barley, empanadas made three appearances during the meal, the last one as a very rich banana, chocolate, and dulce de leche filled bundle of pleasure.  It was the best of four dessert choices, the other ones including an anemic crème brûlée, a pedestrian peanut butter cake, and a serviceable bread pudding.  Nothing exciting.

One more thing about the prodigious use of ""truffle"" oil in restaurants these days:  please don't!  While this product of the ""Flavor"" industry intensely smells of white truffle, it is the lab produced 2.4-dithiapentane chemical compound that gives diners this ersatz experience, possibly ruining them for any true truffle encounter.",2009-11-16 19:15:24

We went with the braised short ribs and the eggplant.  For starters, we had the salmon ceviche with tomatillos and kiwi.  The opposite flavors made this dish really unique but the serving was definitely hard to share.  The ribs were ""fall off the bone"" tender and amazingly tasty.

Hearing that it was a small place, seating about 30 people, I assumed that it would be cramped, but to my surprise, there was plenty of room between tables and plenty of room at each table.

Everyone was pleased with their meals, I was especially pleased with my monkfish and gnocchi, and the house made charcuterie (meat and pate sampler) was pretty good too.

The service was friendly, informative, and attentive; what more can you ask for in a server?  When he brought us the bill, he made sure we knew that gratuity was already included (parties of 6 or more) which is a big plus in my book.

I didn't hesitate to give Saute 5 Yelp stars... the staff was exceptionally hospitable, the food was top-notch yet affordable, and the dining room was warm and intimate.  Basically, Saute helped me look real good on Valentine's Day!

Zack, the place's general manager, greeted us when we arrived, offered my girlfriend a rose (again, helped me look good :) and made sure we felt at home the entire dinner.  He helped us pick a great bottle of Acrobat Oregon 2008 Pinot Gris.  One reason I love dining at these smaller, intimate dining spaces like Saute is because of the personalized service we receive from managers like Zack.

Particularly awesome were the risotto dishes here (between our appetizer and one of the entrees, we had two different risotto dishes) and the 12-day aged NY Strip steak that were on the special V-Day menu.  Another pleasant surprise were the Italian dough balls (I believe they were called Zeppole?) w/chocolate and caramel sauces that we had for dessert.  Zack also offered us a complementary cucumber sorbet w/chili flakes before dessert, which served as a tasty, interesting palate cleanser after finishing off a very flavorful steak.

Firstly, my friends and I (a group of 8 give or take 2) came here for breakfast and every single persons' eggs were disgustingly overcooked. This maybe might not be such a huge deal if everyone ordered scrambled (oh wait, it still would be), but most of us got eggs benedict, which were HORRIFYING. Truly, horrifying.
The second is that they have this little bumper car like thing rotating in the center of the restaurant that you aren't allowed to touch or ride. Yea it is cute to look @ buuUuUut I WANT TO RIDE IT SO BAD (that's what she said) and I can't even IMAGINE what kids must think when they see that. When I was a kid and I wanted to do something, I would want it with my entire body. Oh it must be so torturous for them.
Third, the meatloaf and loaded mashed potatoes were aigghhhtt... but not great, which is strange because I was having XXX fantasies about the taters... kinda disappointing. 

NOW the good. 
Their chicken finger things are DELICIOUS--crispy, salty breading surrounding the TENDER, SUCCULENT and JUICY chicken that can be dipped into ranch, beebeecue or honey mustard sauces (i'm sure there are more but my roomie and i stick to those three). 
The Kobe beef sliders. OMG. OMG. They use Hawaiian rolls and the grilled onions are all caramalizey and ... DROOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!
The BLT's bread was good but the bread (Parmesan-crusted, grilled with butter or oil) was so crunchy that it was literally shredding the skin inside my mouth. OW but a delicious OW.
This turkey sandwich I got with avocado and bacon was also REALLY good and HUGE. I could only eat half  the 'wich and my fries... I couldn't even get a second order of fries!!
Also, they always have $5 coupons floating around (the UCSB money book thing or in the clipper), which are SWEEEET and the ones that I used had no minimum purchase requirement

Note: the ""flavored"" fries they have aren't really worth it or much better than their regular fries.


I clearly eat here way too much. But I would like to add that though it is pretty scrumptious, it's part of a chain. So if you're visiting SB, you may wanna try something that you can only find in SB. I have no suggestions but hey, you're on yelp.


--------------------------------
I wanted to add that I got the root beer float here and it was horrible. The root beer to ice cream ratio was all off. It was like ice cream with a splash of root beer which made the root beer foam out of control like the mouth of a rabies infested animal. They did add more root beer when I asked but all was lost by then... Derf's... now THAT place has some good root beer floats!

---------------------------------
there are two gumball machines. a 25 cent jumbo gumball machine and a one cent teeny gumball machine. i forced my friend to get 10 of the one cent ones, which are obviously a better deal... for 25 cents you can get a LOT of small gumballs... plus what're you gonna do with all those pennies anyway? also, the machine is beaver brand... obviously my favorite brand in the entire world",2008-02-13 21:25:06

There were more insects than people in the restaurant, which is always appetizing. They didn't check how our food was (again, we were his only customers at the time), and the food itself was below-average quality and expensive.

Just a few blocks from Gayle on Fronts St. you'll find Saute, a cozy Contemporary American spot on the periphery of Queen Village.

I saw this place open up back in Late Winter and eagerly awaited dropping by after the opening kinks were worked out.

We went on a busy Friday night, arriving a little after 9. The interior is quite dark, both the soft candle-lighting and the full-length mirrored wood sideboard seem to throw a warm glow over the darkness.

We were seated at a two-top in the center aisle of the restaurant.   Although I'm used to typically packed-in seating with Philly dining, at least twice my elbow was bumped by passing customers and wait-staff, nearly knocking the glass out of my hand.

If the seating wasn't vexing enough, our waitress was about to take our orders, but spun around to respond to a table of four that seated about 15 minutes after us.  Before taking our order, our server was rushed by the just-seated four-top, who proceeded to order their drinks, apps & mains all before the waitress even introduced herself. 

The group snatched the last portions of the duck and lamb entrees we had our eyes on, so, slightly annoyed at being bumped  and not really thrilled by the other entree options (there were about 3 choices remaining that evening), we passed on mains entirely and just went with two apps & a split dessert.

It was so dark in here I had trouble capturing this lobster & sepia-ravioli appetizer on camera. The dough was undercooked but the filling was decent..the one of the three that was not undercooked was delicious.

I had the sauteed sweetbread...crispy outside and soft inside, the sweetbread was perfectly cooked...I was tempted to order another.

We finished with a berry empanada & ice cream...the flaky dough and tart berries were bright and buttery.

Normally we'd write a place like this off, but the atmosphere, minus the elbow-bumps, the warm service, minus the breakdown in handling the table orders, and the food, minus the undercooked pasta, all promised that once the opening kinks were worked out, Saute could be a decent neighborhood BYOB, along the lines of Salt & Pepper or Cochon.

I mentioned Saute to another chef later that night and he agreed that they needed to work through some opening issues but that the overall outlook was promising.

We went back for brunch about two weeks later with an out-of-town friend and it was literally like night & day.  The food came out perfectly, the service was still a little disjointed but warm and helpful, while the overall atmosphere was relaxing enough that we lingered over a bottle of sparkling wine.

Here's a shot of our friend's French toast, [PIC ABOVE] serve with roasted pears. He was pleased with the flavor and was a bit surprised at the soft consistency of the pears. They also had a buttermilk pancake one the menu.

Although the truffled Eggs Benedict looked good on the menu, I ordered the Croques Madam, tuna confit with a sunny egg, mainly because I wondered what a tuna confit would taste like.  Mingled with the egg, the tuna had a smooth consistency, but packed plenty of flavor and did not resemble a warmed tuna salad in the least, which was my fear.  There was a kalamata sauce that was drizzled across the plate that, while good, made the bread a little soggy.  The accompanying salad was lightly dressed in a vinaigrette.

Elizabeth's Salmon BLT was the sandwich I was wishing I'd ordered...crunchy bacon, tomato and cool salmon, served atop a dill sauce, made for a clever twist on a classic sandwich. Again, if the sandwich had not been served atop the sauce, the bread would've been toasty good and gone great with the bacon & salmon.

I think with a earlier reservation and request for a table alongside the wall, Saute could be a BYOB option.",2009-04-06 04:10:16

The broccoli is steamed nicely and the shrimp are a decent size.  Their eggrolls are just okay but I can live with an okay eggroll so long as the entree itself is above average.  Which it totally is.

I have also tried their ""house"" lomein which has all the veggies PLUS chicken, shrimp, and pork.

Mmm, was this place good. Perfect setting for Valentines day weekend.  Dark, cozy and small. The host was very friendly and accomodated us right away even though we arrived super early. I started off with the soup of the day- veg minestrone- so good and hearty and warmed me up from the brutal cold outside. My bf had the Salmon Ceviche- one word: WOW! This combination of Salmon, Kiwi and pomagrante was so amazing! I had to control myself from not reaching over and beating him to the finish! 

Now Entrees- The Braised short ribs were heaven on a plate! Again, the bf's choice yet I found myself constantly giving him puppy dog eyes for another taste- they seriously melted in your mouth.

I had the special of the day- bone in pork chops that were accompanied with broccolli rabe and finger licking potatos- Best pork chop I've ever had! It was so moist, and flavorful- cooked in a citrus like glaze. 

As if the entrees weren't enough- we splurged for dessert- the dolce de leche gelato was amazing- a perfect little scoop to finish off your meal with. 

Our waitor was awesome- so friendly and just the right balance of entertaining and helpful- not too pushy- not too distant.

Second course was by far the best - 6 stars even. Perfectly seared scallops over creamy polenta topped with tomatoes in a tangy vinagrette. The dish was completely balanced, and the tomatoes were some of the most flavorful i've had in a long time.

Third course were two seared fish dishes - a brazilian white seared and over wild rice pilaf, and salmon over white rice & greenbeans. Both of these were delicious, but followed a tough act.

The food was at least average, as usual, when we finally did get it. From the time we entered it didn't seem like the servers cared whether we were there or not - and it wasn't like it was busy even though it was Sunday morning. When we finally did get out food both our orders were almost completely cold. As I don't like to send things back (you never know what you will get added the second time) I just ate as much as I could. My wife, however, asked for fresh and hot pancakes as hers were totally cold. The response by the server was the only thing that was fast today - 30 seconds later she was back with the pancakes she or the cook had simply microwaved, not made new and hot. Totally not acceptable. Had Jake been there this morning we would have spoken to him regarding it, but he was nowhere to be found.

There are two in my neighborhood that don't make the cut (one is huge selection, poor quality; the other is tiny selection, good quality). Many of the more up scale buffets were also out of the question because I didn't want to drop $20. After reading Bob's review, I was set and his review was right on the money.

Britton Plaza is a weird hodge podge of shops and even a movie theater, but as we were walking in, my fears were instantly dashed when I saw a young Asian couple leave. When my friend and I got inside, we were impressed with the clean look, the sound of jazz music in the background and the large area.

There are a ton of serving tables - raw bar seafood, vegetables and salads, two for hot foods, one for soups and dim sum, one for making your own stir fry, a sushi bar, and two desert bars.

Highlights

-Peanut Chicken: this was probably the best item on the menu. This chicken lightly fried and in a great peanut sauce.
-Dim Sum: while limited to only wontons, pork shumai , sticky rice and chicken's feet, I was impressed that it even existed. And hey, I finally got to try chicken's feet (very boney).
-Honey Chicken: ok, you can get this anywhere, but it was very good.
-fried squid: also had very nice flavor

Now I'm not going to lie - the sushi tasted frozen, but you're not coming here only for sushi. There was only one beef dish that was only ok, and I can't recall a real pork dish, but with chicken and broccoli, chicken and mushrooms, and a large selection of seafood dishes (three types of fish, ginger crab, prawns, seafood delight, seafood salad) and other standard buffet staples you are not want for anything.

MGWEoQZQWxSoP1kkLwMfhg,tKsuyJRlzUwB0yBEvfaZag,ADVW2S9Ucm6UrKSxLOXpxA,5,5,7,5,"I recently had a revelation, an epiphany of sorts. I like so many others have done before me have decided to use the Internet to shout it from the online mountaintop: I AM NEEDY. Not in my relationships with men, or even with friends, but with Restaurants. And no, not in the way you are thinking. I am not the type of patron that demands say 5 lemons to go with my water,crust removed from sandwiches, or even fast service. No, I am Needy in that I actually need, better yet, require, their services. 

You see I am Cooking Challenged, a feral female whose sole reason for being in a kitchen is for the takeout menu du jour.This means a life full of bringing mixers & cocktail concoctions to BBQs, canned cranberry in fancy dishes at Thanksgiving, store-bought pastries placed in a monogrammed dishware giving it that ""I slaved for hours over these"" personal touch and never being asked to bring anything that resembles food to potlucks.I am the one that brings napkins, linens or silverware to office parties since I'm incapable of chips & dips. Yes,I am ""that girl"". And I can't blame them,given that the last time I made something for a company party ended in HR calling the Fire Dept after I put in, what is now kindly referred to as my Ring of Fire Dip, in the microwave. Allegedly,you can't put tinfoil in the microwave.

Not having the luxury of making an entrée,or even a gosh darn dip on my own accord,is where this Needy behavior has stemmed from. In order to survive,I am confined to whatever nearby bistro or café is cooking up,and can only cross my fingers and hope for the best.Well, I can finally get that 4-leaf clover tramp stamp tattoo permanently removed, because I no longer need luck after finding the neighborhood treasure better known as Sauté.

My fascination was first piqued after reading their menu online. My eyes widened at the words: Truffle Eggs Benedict.Could this be? My two loves together at last! Like any regular US Weekly reader,I knew I had to check my sources to see if my Eggs would in fact be canoodling with Truffle Hollandaise. Without delay I called Sauté only to find that they are not currently open for brunch,but will reopen October 3rd. So, I decided to do the next best thing and try their dinner on for size. 

I make my reservations for a Saturday evening and when we arrive we were quickly seated because we were the only table.This would change if they decided to join 2009 and get a Website ASAP. The server offered a few helpful suggestions & we placed our order.I the Escargot to start and the Diver Scallops as my entrée.Don't get me wrong, the escargot was terrific, but I don't want those of you with ADD to lose focus on what's really important: the White Chocolate Parsnip Puree that in one bite started a courtship with my taste buds that could rival Romeo & Juliet,or at least Kevin Arnold & Winnie Cooper, promise ring and all.It was the perfect amount of sweetness, bringing out a melodic range of flavors that I have never discovered before this venture. It was almost like the chef had become Ponce De Leon and found a new land in my mouth.The chopped up pieces of apple & bacon were the perfect accouterment to this already flawless fodder.I didn't want it to end.I wanted to pick up my dish and lick it in order to savor every last iota but restrained myself in order to appease my date which was already a bit jealous by my reaction to the scallops. 
 
After such a pleasing experience you can imagine how hard it was to wait to go back for more.With my codependent nature heightened,my behavior started to resemble that of a women starring in tonight's Lifetime Movie: late night drive-by to see if they were home,calling & hanging up and stalking their Myspace page til October 3rd arrived.When the day finally comes, the server says that they are no longer offering the Truffle Eggs Benny BUT he would gladly have the chefs make it for me.Wow,what a guy!

The eminent dish arrives with less fanfare as I had originally hoped for. Surely Doves could have been released at the exact moment I indulged in my first bite,or better yet a Fog Machine...but the server rubbed his eye that after a few mimosas could be taken as a wink so I move in for the kill.After just one taste,I fell so hard,In love with it,oh-oh,oh-oh.The hollandaise makes you feel like a god walking amongst mere mortals. With every bite my attachment to the dish grows,making it harder to harbor my new found weakness,so I gave in & started to do the Shake Dat Ass dance, you know the one from 1997: (_/_) (_|_) (_\_) Heck,I would have ended with the cabbage patch into its my bday dance, if my date wasn't giving me looks that I have all too often given my parents when I was mortified,so I sat back down. 

Needless to say, I am now in another committed relationship, where the restaurant has the upper hand. Sauté literally has me eating out of the palm of their hand. And it has never tasted better!",2009-11-17 17:34:05

A large sign outside claimed that they were in the midst of their grand opening.  Normally I give a place a few months to work out the kinks rather than potentially ruining it for myself early on. I should have done so for this place.

The decor and service was perfect for a breakfast & lunch spot. Lots of tables available inside, outdoor seating and not crammed too close together.
The saran wrapped breakfast specials at the door could be displayed under cake domes or something more appetizing.
Friendly, attentive though somewhat junior service (waiters looked nervous about carrying more than two plates and constantly reached across my plate to serve another person at my table or refill coffee).
The three of us ordered simple breakfasts and bypassed the heavily promoted chicken fried steak.

All of our meals arrived stone cold about a half hour later. 
Over medium eggs were cooked perfectly but obviously sat for too long. I ordered crispy bacon and it arrived limp and oily. Good coffee but took too long to get cream refilled. 
I believe Jake himself strolled by near the end of our meal and asked how things were. 
I like that he is interested to hear feedback but he did nothing when he saw our plates still quite full of food and after hearing that everything arrived cold. 
If you're going to ask, perhaps be ready to offer some type of make-good to try and impress patrons again during a future visit?

 I love coming to little hideout spots like this. I always wonder why there isn't any more press about places like this.

It's a gem...simply put.

The problem is that it's tucked off in a very very small shopping center on Morrison that looks like it's still suffering from stunted growth due to Katrina.

Who cares...the food is great and the service is phenomenal too. a small family makes sure your glass is always full and you always have what you need.

We were seated outside, off to the side, which was a little awkward feeling because it felt like that is where the trash gets put when the restaurant is closed, yet it provided the comfort of  breathing room. The music was little loud, which would be ok if the music was appealing.
We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was not ceviche at all- it was blanched shrimp  that was cut in half lengthwise, served over a heaping portion of equally blanch celery root. To taste it felt like the the shrimp was never touched by any acid, in this case lime as it was written on the menu. We also had tuna two ways- that was pretty good.The first way was carppachio, the other was tartar. It could have benefited from something crunchy added to it or served off to the side. Both ways had the same texture.
Service was dull. There was very little interaction with our server ( at least we believe it was our server...there was no introduction). One of the mangers kept pacing around outside that created an air of anxiety.

For entree, we had the brozinno grilled and the sea bass. The brozinno was on top of fontina fondue which was was quite good.It had some other tasty accompiants such as capers, pine nuts, onions, and broccoli rabe..oh and fennel. All of them though had a minor role and it would have been better if the chef had just choose two to highlight the dish in larger portions. Good portions and decent taste, but have had better. The sea bass was the better of the two entrees./ It was on top of marscapone polenta, which actually stole the show.

next was the duck breast and baked chicken pasta and a side of asparagus. the duck breast was perfect, succulent & flavorful, not even close to dry, served with dirty mashed potatoes. the baked chicken pasta was a wonderful creamy mess. chicken, pasta & mushrooms baked a delicious creamy pasta sauce.

First, I will analyze the food. As usual I panicked and couldn't decide between the regular or boneless wings. I decided to go with the hot boneless wings (with a little guidance from our waitress). It came with 12 wings and I also ordered a chicken quesadilla on the side. The chicken quesadilla was delicious but the wings were what will bring me back in the future. It was nothing short of spectacular and that is saying something given my high wing standards. The wings were hot but not overwhelming and had a perfect combination of a crispy breading on the outside and a soft tender inside, bursting with flavor. The food was not only delicious but was very reasonably priced. The wings are even cheaper on Thursdays for Wing Night!

The service at Naceville was spectacular. We actually had two waitresses that were both extremely attentive and polite. In addition to the excellent service the wait time for the food was extremely short. I'd estimate our wait time at about 10-12 minutes. I'm not sure they get too many customers during the week so I would suggest leaving a nice tip.

Overall, I was VERY happy with my experience at Naceville and it is safe to say I will be returning. As a new resident to the Telford community I am excited to have a quality wing restaurant close by that's both affordable and delicious. I highly recommend trying it out.",2014-10-23 00:21:04

In all fairness, it was hard to find a gluten-free and soy-free option which is where I'm at these days, so that did influence my dining experience. I would like to see veggie restaurants creating at least one dish on the menu that is primarily veggies and still really flavorful. I think these places tend to lean a bit heavily on tofu/seitan/tempeh, forgetting that some people are veggie because they really *want* vegetables. If you're a tofu/seitan/tempeh lover, this place is probably for you, and you may like it a lot better than I did.

Pan Tai is just so wrong on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. Let's begin with the menu, it's not exactly Thai, Pan-Asian, or even the ubiquitous Asian fusion. It's just a strange melange of Thai, a smattering of Vietnamese, and a hearty dose of inauthentic Chinese (or what used to be called Chinese-American). And an expensive and poorly executed melange at that. ($18 for a plate of primarily noodles and vegetables, in WIlmington yet!)

There was one harried waiter when we arrived who was later supplemented to no great effect by a few owner-manager types.

Baby's Pad Thai was just awful. As another reviewer noted, it's full of celery, not to mention mushrooms and red peppers and other things that no self-respecting Pad Thai should include. All covered in a drippy, watery sauce over broken rice noodles. (And why did the waiter ask how hot it should be, I've never known Pad Thai to be a spicy dish in any incarnation I've seen before.)

My Singapore Noodles had the same abundance of celery, red peppers, and broccoli with a most meager serving of chicken (about 6 thin, dry quarter-sized slices) and shirmp (about 6 very small, tough ones). All over thin, lifeless noodles coated in an indeterminable greasy red sauce. Yeccchhhh!

anyway, i started with a lobster roll which was really the best part of dinner.  but who doesn't love lobster and mayo and white bread?  cute little presentation and the fries were a nice touch.  honestly this would make a good entree, though it's listed a starter.  the SO had a beet salad - and considering i don't even care for beets, this was pretty good, with beets done several ways, some tasty micro greens, and a really good dressing.  for my main was a trout done a couple ways, poached and as tartare.  tartare was excellent with a weird little red onion marshmallow.  poached version (the majority of the dish) was decent but not my cup o tea, personally.  trout isn't a particularly interesting fish IMO, so i was interested to see what they did with it, even tho i knew better.  but i was impressed with the tartare, definitely.  the SO had a venison dish, which i don't eat.  it came 4 or 5 different ways, a LOT of meat.  a couple were reported as great, a couple were left on the plate.  
this place is PRICEY.  i'm OK with the occasional expensive restaurant, but i only tend to mention price as a negative when the food value doesn't seem in line with the prices.  i think they were a bit high.  while the food was good, it wouldn't make my 'come back on a special occasion' list... however the prices won't let me come back for anything else.  very creative concept, though, and i'm glad i got to try it.  a little worried for them, tho: on a friday evening, it was empty.  poor place.",2009-01-10 03:20:07

Thanks to Michael M.'s review and notice that Gayle was to close, I quickly made a reservation and had dinner here last night.  I don't know why it took so long to finally eat here - and I truly regret not doing it sooner.

I had the five course tasting menu (after it was recommended by a fellow diner)- and at $75 (yes - this place is on the pricier side) - it was worth every penny.  If the weather permits, sit in the back patio.

Service was attentive, so polite, engaging and knowledgeable - it was the cherry on our delicious dining sundae.  Because I made the culinary oversight of not eating here sooner, I thought it best to try out the tasting menu to really experience what the kitchen could do - I'm so glad that I did.  

It began with a goat cheese, pesto and beet amuse-bouche, bread hot from the oven with homemade garlicky butter.  First, a summery gazpacho, with two jumbo poached shrimp and a summer salad served on top.  Followed by a perfectly cooked slice ahi tuna on a bed of leek basmati herb rice, a side of tuna tartare and a curry ice cream.  Third course, came in the form of an expertly cooked beef tenderloin with fresh sweet corn fricassé, chanterelles, fingerling potatoes.  Fourth course, le fromage - a pungent stinky brie, baguette slice, cherries and leafy greens.  Our dinner came to a refreshing end with a summer soup (too many ingredients to list here!) along with brownie and angel macadamia cake bites.  In all, it was perfection and something I won't get the chance to experience again.

So go. Now. Before it's too late.  You won't regret it.",2009-08-28 15:35:38

(Or perhaps a hole in the wall taqueria - those are always the best.)  So yeah, I'm a mexican food snob, and honestly my tummy turned every time a waiter went by with a tray full of entrees to be served, because they were the typical smothered-in-cheese calorie bombs one usually finds in chain mexican restaurants.  If that's your bag, then you will love this place.  And judging by how packed it was on a Friday (happy hour), it must be popular.

This review is specifically for the rooftop bar, which is GREAT.  On my quest for the perfect outdoor happy hour hangout in my area (hah.  I don't even have a ""real"" job - I'm usually off on Fridays altogether, why am I so keen on finding a good happy hour spot?  Excuse to drink?) I think I might have found it on the roof of the 3 story Coyote Cafe.  It gets sun much longer than Teca, which is awesome by the way, but not if you want to be sunnin' with a margarita in your hand.  They did an excellent job with the space.  

Ok the downside - not only was it PACKED, but it was packed with a high proportiion of *ahem* that older West Chester crowd.  Those of you who hang in the area - you know who I mean.  They're fine.  Perfectly nice, have as much a right to partake on a Friday afternoon as the other age groups.  But it would be nice to find a place with a late 20s - mid 30's crowd.  But I'm in the burbs, and beggers can't be choosers.  So for now, this will replace Teca as my Friday hangout on sunny days - but for drinks ONLY.

The menu is deceptive and the owners only care about your money... because they obviously don't care about the quality of food or being truthful about the quality of food.

There are old 70's style banquet chairs and diner tables. A cheesy bar and games area that makes you feel like you're in a schizophrenic restaurant without any sense of identity. The menus are sticky and covered in grease and old food crumbs and smears. The restaurant smells like spilt booze and stale beer. 

The Food: OMG this food is ridiculously over priced for the horrible quality.
They took ingredients with potential and completely ruined any chance of good quality food. The lettuce was full of water and soaking wet. The potatoes where not cooked through. The finger steaks were cooked to well done with a soggy batter around them with a horrible burnt oil smell. Would you believe they have the audacity to serve frozen vegetables that have been boiled or microwaved to death? Yuk! Soggy baby food vegetables without any love or care for quality. 

I hope these owners go bankrupt or out of business soon to make way for a restaurant that actually cares about customers, quality, and self respect.

Shelby, our server, was so nice and polite, but no one is there to manage the staff correctly. The menus are disgraceful and the cleanliness was pathetic. 
This place is stuck in 1985 and must learn the hard way how to run a business that works apparently, because I have let everyone I know to stay clear of this place and to never give your hard earned money to this lazy, un-inspired, and deceptive Boise establishment.",2015-01-25 20:39:37

Purchased steamed dumplings (not on the menu) which were okay.  I've had better but they weren't offensive.  Doughy, with golf sized meatballs in the center.  Filling was pretty much just meat.  Dumplings came in some type of soy sauce blend which was okay.  Not great but not awful either.  Now here comes the bad part...

Pad Tai.  Healthy amount of chicken, fair amount of shrimp.  Peanuts on the side  (I get it..very conscientious if you have an allergy.)  Too, too much celery.  At least twice as much celery as there was chicken and shrimp.  Also green peppers, not diced, but halves of green peppers. Oddly, no cilantro and no bean sprouts.  No lime either.  The noodles were flat egg noodles, not traditional pad thai noodles.  The sauce was just soy, not standard tamarind and fish sauce.  The noodles were also broken into pieces so they were hardly noodles at all.  Again, not the worst Pad Thai I've ever had but certainly in the bottom 3.  I feel bad writing this as the manager was really a nice guy who was visibly hurting from the lack of business.

Uglesich's was well noted for their fresh and always local seafood.  Their food was certainly good and it had a unique flair that made it different from any other area location.  I did enjoy my meals there but it wasn't worth a three hour wait to me and I would only venture to eat there when I could catch a day with a short line.  Sadly this is another NOLA institution that ""ain't there no more"" and I still miss it when I often drive past it on my way home.

She short changed one of the guests on the meal (advising her that she could either have one side or another, when it was clear on the menu that it was both), getting our orders wrong upon delivery even getting the drinks wrong.

We went tonight, and it was busier than we've ever seen. Every single table was taken. However, the servers were on their game and the quality of our meals were not impacted by the rush. 
What to order here? My first pick is the broasted chicken. So yummy. (I think it's the closest to southern fried chicken in the area!) Also, the finger steaks. This place is in the top 10 restaurants in the state for finger steaks. The meat is so tender and juicy! Most times you order it anywhere else and the meat is tough, but not here. My only complaint really is that the veggies you get on the side are steamed, and I don't think they're very flavorful. But...I don't come here for the veggies. (Don't bring your vegan friends here, they won't appreciate it!)

We each had the eight-course Chef's Tasting Menu that included Gayle Clam Chowder, a combo plate of raw oyster, smoked salmon, foie gras torchon, and cucumber soda, Sweetbreads with Dates and Carmelized Onions, Seared Ahi Tuna with Curry Ice Cream and Basmati Rice topped with Tuna Tartare (totally yummy), Beef Tenderloin and Shepherd's Pie, Veal Stew, French Cheddar with Chocolate Sauce, an intermezzo of strawberry and basil sorbet, and a dessert called Breakfast. The dessert bears special mention because the chef likes to give all of his dishes interesting names that give you just a hint of what the dish is really like. For example, Breakfast gives you a slice of white chocolate French toast that is more like a moist cake sitting in a sea of maple syrup topped with a scoop of white chocolate ice cream that looks like an overeasy egg. The Shepard's Pie is a cylinder of potato with minced beef in its core and topped with a potato dumpling. The Veal Stew, the dish that won Chef Daniel Stern many awards, was a plate of four different preparations of veal, including breast of veal, veal tenderloin, veal tongue, and veal mousse dumpling. But the dish that solidified the chef's genius to me was the Seared Ahi Tuna with Curry Ice Cream and Basmati Rice topped with Tuna Tartare. It is a pregnant woman's dream dish and there I sat fat and happy enjoying the chef's latest culinary creation as it warmed my belly! The only dish that was weak for me was the Gayle Clam Chowder, which I found to be too salty. Prior to our courses, we were presented with an amuse-bouche, a delicious little red beet and goat cheese salad, and after our courses, we were given petit fours of tiny diced brownies. As the New York Times says, ""This type of eating isn't for everyone, but for the adventuresome gourmet, it's sheer, stylish delight.""

There was one more patron, looked like a business man finishing up some work before his flight. Other than that, the place was empty.

The waitress took about 15 or so minutes before she came to check what I'd like to drink and take our orders. My mom and pops ordered the American Breakfast. Eggs, choice of bacon, ham, sausage links, choice of hash browns or grits, and toast or a biscuit. I ordered the Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict. 

It was two small, all be it freshly made, crab cakes with poached eggs and hollandaise. I know they were fresh because there was small pieces of crab shell. This doesn't bother me because it's a sign of freshness. It was served with hashbrowns, which there were very few of for close to $20.00

The bacon and ham looked to be overcooked on my folks plates and my mom's grits were definitely under cooked. The hash browns were actually just small new potatoes that were cut in quarters and thrown in a pan.  When my crab cakes were brought out, the server had not let the chef place the poached eggs on top. I mentioned it and right then the, chef walked out to tell her he had not yet finished the dish.

Here's a great tip, if the portions seem too large for one person, you can split an entree and for a little less than $5 more, both of you can get your own sides without having to order them a' la carte.  We split the 12 oz. prime rib entree (with salad, 1/2 loaded baked potato, steamed veggies, and a roll each).

    GAYLE TO CLOSE

    PHILADELPHIA (August 13, 2009) - After five successful years, Daniel Stern's Gayle restaurant will close its doors after dinner service on Friday, September 4. Daniel Stern Restaurants (DSR) decided not to renew the lease, which is up this fall, to focus on its two imminent openings, MidAtlantic (slated to open in September) and R2L (slated to open in November).

    ""While this is certainly a bittersweet decision, we have some very exciting projects to focus on in the immediate future,"" Chef Stern says. ""The elements that made Gayle so beloved will definitely play major roles in our new restaurants.""

    Stern received much acclaim for creative and innovative interpretations of American cuisine at his Philadelphia restaurants Gayle and Rae. Stern will continue his tradition of blending bold cuisine with dynamic spaces when he brings two exciting new projects, MidAtlantic and R2L to Philadelphia this fall.",2009-08-14 19:32:43

We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. The place was busy. The poor woman working out front could have used some help to be honest but she was doing a good job managing it all alone. She kept our drinks full which certainly speaks volumes when a place is busy. We were a bit disappointed that you can't get steaks at lunch. You could get Finger Steaks, prime rib dip, grilled steak strips or a steak sandwich but not a regular steak. I ordered the steak sandwich with a salad on the side. Steak sandwich is served open face on a French roll. It had beautiful grill marks and was cooked as ordered. Salad was crisp. No complaints except it could have been seasoned more. Husband had the finger steaks and fries. He loved them both. 

This is a casual place, where you come when you aren't in a hurry. So many places you eat and they hurry you along to seat the next diner.

Bummer for you.  Every day, all day they have $4 beers served in icy cold mugs.  These are not short pours or childish, candy-flavored ""local craft"" beers served at places popular with the frivolous foodie crowd.  This is real value, something that is missing in the many places who chase business with ads, glitz and contemporary social media ""influencers.""

Every day, all day, they serve $3 wells that are not short pours.  When I get their Bloody Mary at $3.25, it counts as a daily serving of vegetables.

The bartenders and waitresses are some of the friendliest and fun folk around the Valley.  It is clear from the regulars who fill the place every day, that this is a comfort zone with engaging, personable staff.  Plenty of TV's on the walls, game machines, pool table and a jukebox playing a mix of country & rock keeps the bar area busy.  The daily lunch specials are popular as are the daily dinner specials. Later in the evening, the restaurant dining room in the back part of the building opens for a quieter environment.

Today started with a Shock Top for the Mrs. and an 805 for me served in frozen mugs.  The bartender was joking with us when I asked if they had any imported beers on tap and I got the response: ""805 is from California.""  'Nuff said.

We got the fish and chips, the Rueben sandwich and some of their 85 cent wings.  The wings were gigantic, tender & juicy in the middle and nicely crispy on the outside - a 10 out of 10.  The fish was lightly battered and also nicely cooked with plenty of fries.  The Rueben was a well-constructed meal.  Lots of tender meat, covered in gooey, melted Swiss cheese, along with yummy sauerkraut, dressed with Thousand Island, all parked between two large slices of marbled rye and served with lots of perfectly cooked fries.  While some places in the Treasure Valley would have made any or all of these dishes with loads of oil & greasiness - not the case here.   Someone in this kitchen has skill.   All of this food for $25 made lunch a real value proposition.

On previous occasions, we have tried their steak sandwich and finger steaks.  Both were excellent and we agree with their claim that they have the best finger steaks in the Valley.  We have tried a number of other places and have been turned off by what passes as finger steaks in some establishments.

Highly recommended.",2021-03-06 16:27:08

they have everything though- especially the appetizer menu- fried everything! the salad I got first came out so fresh, and the blue cheese dressing was clearly house made and had chunks in it- the best! I ordered a cheeseburger with grilled onions and bacon- came out hot and fresh. fries were crispy and hot.

hubby got the .85 (yes you read that right) chicken wings- which were scalding hot (that's a good thing), and GIGANTIC. the buffalo sauce came on the side and it was also house made and fantastic. 

the beers come out so cold and frosty your hand gets stuck to the mug. that's awesome.

my mom got the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp and it was swimming in house made sauce and plump fresh shrimp. garlic bread aplenty on her plate too. everything came out piping. 

lastly, the service was great the servers were super nice and very attentive.

Hubby had heard this place had good fingersteaks and he was looking for a steak. 
First impression, a bit smoky smelling, expected in a bar. Music not too loud, lighting ok. Dirty tables along the wall with food from previous diners sitting there. About 3 other tables actually occupied and maybe 7 or 8 bar patrons at the bar and playing pool.
Directed to sit anywhere, we found a table without food remnants and sat. Asked for 2 water and a bar drink. I got a water, he eventually got the drink, but not the water. Also no tableware in sight. Eventually it was brought after our food arrived.
He ordered a 13oz ribeye with a baked potato and a salad.  I order fish n chips and fingersteaks.  He got the salad at the same time as the steak. I don't know if it was a ribeye it looked like whoever cooked it pressed it so hard all the juice was gone. It was tender enough but NO flavor. He had sauteed mushrooms and did enjoy those HUGE baked potato, but tiny cup of toppers, i don't think they charged extra though.
 I got my fish first, there were 4 battered cubes like one piece of fish cut into 4 pieces and then fried. It did taste fresh and was hot. The fries were good.  Then i got the fingersteaks and some onion rings. I enjoyed the onion rings, they may have been previously frozen, but they tasted good. The fingersteaks to me were a letdown. The batter looked and tasted as if the oil wasn't clean. The meat inside was so- so. I have had fingersteaks anywhere they're available and these would rate a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being gross and 10 being delicious.
Hubby said the drinks were really good, even if he was slow to get his water. 
I don't know if there were patrons in another room or how many people were working, so service was a little inattentive to us but there could be circumstances to be fair. When we left about 90 minutes later, i noticed the same tables still not cleared that had been there when we arrived.
Overall atmosphere: fair, not too loud tables dirty
Service: pleasant but a bit slow
Food:  steak not worth the price, fried items decent, not too greasy
Drinks: strong
Conclusion: have a couple of drinks, order some fried items to eat with them.",2021-12-23 09:12:21

They brought a loaf of bread that was more like a big hotdog bun (it seems they charge you 1 dollar for this, they don't ask if you want it or not).

After I got my plate, the meat looked great, when I cut it, the inside was cooked to medium as I ordered, but there was absolutely no seasoning what so ever, not even a little bit of salt.  Even though it was tender, it tasted like refrigerator shelf.  Also, my steamed veggies were very garlicky.

I tired fixing it with a bit of salt and pepper, but after two bites I couldn't eat it any more.

Stick to the martini's, enjoy the view and the snazzy decor but whatever you do avoid the food.  Oh, but we didn't try the martini's so they might suck too.

It is right smack dab in the middle of the spectrum between dive beach shack crab stand type places and frou frou stuck up overpriced fancy pants places.  It's just a nice, yet pretty laid-back spot.  So kudos for pulling that off.

The food is amazing.  Everything I have had there has been fabulous and don't even get me started on their mojitos.

My wife and I had to head over to Tucson because a family member is in the hospital there (Tucson Medical Center).  After looking around for hotels, we found the Ramada Inn on Tanque Verde and asked the man at the front desk for a restaurant that he would recommend.  He suggested this place and we went next door.

This place was NICE.  They serve drinks of all kinds--I had a very nice apple cider (hard) and the wife had a couple of tequila sunrises.  For dinner, I got a HUMONGOUS chili dog with beef chili and she got the corned beef and cabbage.  The smell off of that corned beef and cabbage was incredible and the taste (I tried a bite) was like homemade.  
There were subtle spices and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was great down to the brownie to finish the meal.  Service was attentive and the place had great ambiance.

I was quite impressed by the location, which of course is what you're paying for since you are pretty much IN the water.  
We sat outside since of course why would you sit inside.  There weren't too many tables left so we got one right next to the entrance...not too bad.  There was a family next to us but luckily they soon got up and left.  Unluckily and even louder family of 7 sat down and were extremely annoying!  It really put a damper on my lunch to the point where we kind of hurried to eat and get out of there.
Food...
We had the lobster cocktail appetizer which was really good (I love lobster).  For lunch I wasn't too hungry and went with the crab cake appetizer.  It only came with one cake though it was a really decent size...I was somewhat disappointed but found it quite filling and hardly was able to finish.  It was actually a really really tasty crab cake.  I've had the best of the best, from Maine and Maryland and I really must say it had a good amount of crab...not all bread like you usually find.
My BF had the clam chowder which was really tasty until he put Tabasco in it.  He was hoping for breakfast but seeing as it was Saturday we had just missed the cut off and so he ordered a bacon sandwich.  Not what I would have eaten at a place on the beach but it was good for what it was.
I probably wouldn't make it a point to go back here.  The view was nice.  But I could bring a sandwich to the beach and stay away from loud children any day and probably be happier.",2007-08-06 17:45:49

Decor- pretty standard asian fusion designs with comfortable seating.  It has a really good feel to it and calming. 

Appetizer- so I'll agree with the previous comment, the crab raggoon, did seem like it came from the frozen box generic crap you'll find at walmart and its $5 bucks for 4 small tiny lil things, save your $5 bucks. 

Lunch- bento box w/ teriyaki chicken and edamame, also had a taste of the ginger salad.  California rolls could have used more avacado and looked small to comparison to other sushi joints i've been too *which is a lot * Teriyaki is pretty much the standard, cant really mess it up and its a good portion. Edamame, cant mess that up, the fried rice didnt have much taste to it but it wasnt bad though. Ginger Salad sauce is bland. 

Service- she was extremely nice and joked around with us which is nice to see when usually most servers are robotic in the things they say and do.

My mom and my aunt certainly put the lush in luscious. They immediately spied the make-your-own bloody mary and mimosa bar and mixed up a couple of glasses of vodka with a splash of tomato juice. They then proceeded to munch on the array of veggies, cheeses, salamis and stuffed peppers thoughtfully provided at the bar... until the bartender looked over, aghast, and proclaimed rather haughtily that ""SOME people like to use those to GARNISH THEIR DRINKS.""

We were greeted within seconds of walking in and seated promptly. I could even tell that they were trying to give me and my partner a bit of space between us and a louder, larger party, so I have to give them some points for consideration, instead of just packing us in like Tetris.

Our waiter was friendly, courteous, and exuded pride in the restaurant and the food with every interaction. He asked questions and made subtle suggestions from the menu in a way that was helpful, not pushy. He also was completely knowledgeable of the selection of their full bar and beers on tap. (The experienced bartender made a stellar martini, by the way.)

We decided to sample both a sushi roll and a noodle dish, so I can't speak to the quality of their appetizers as we had our rolls first instead. I can tell you that their ""Monk""-ey Business roll -- crab stick, banana, eel, and eel sauce -- was creative and super tasty. All the flavors blended perfectly. My partner's ""Tree Hugger"" veggie roll was a great blend of veggies, flash-cooked, but still with a bit of bite and bright flavor.

After our rolls, we sampled two different noodle dishes. I had the pad thai with chicken, with a bit of extra spice. The chicken tasted char grilled and paired well with their pad thai sauce. I'm not sure if it was a traditional recipe or not, but the flavors of tamarind and peanut were bold, but melded. My partner's vegetarian lo mein didn't skimp on the vegetables and was seasoned well and not oily like take-out lo mein.

We only ate part of our noodle dishes so we could try one of their desserts, which was a caramel banana cheesecake egg roll. All I can say: share it with a friend. It was crazy good, though.

So, between the well-prepared creative menu, the fantastic service, and the reasonable prices, I had a lovely night at Buddha Lounge. I was also excited to see that they've put some forethought into the bar area. This looks like it could be a good go-to place for drinks OR a full meal. And with the lounge-y, jazzy atmosphere, it's a nice break from hip-hop-rock-n-roll Ybor.",2010-03-01 03:42:22

It's my understanding that the owners made a bid to lease it again, but the owners of the Fishouse bid higher and now have control of the space.
Unknown when it'll re-open. I walked by the building on Christmas Eve and it was all boarded up.

They had great views, just look at the beautiful photo Jane K uploaded, and I thought the breakfasts were decent. Only a buck or so more than other places, and a seat just feet from the ocean.

Rumor has it the space will reopen as ""The Boathouse"" in spring 2008.",2008-01-08 17:51:49

I'm here just for the weekend and my boyfriend swears this is one of the best places. He never lies about food  NEVER. Once again, he was right! Period. The chopped wings are good af and seasoned well. The fried rice is mf heavenly. If you're looking for a bomb Chinese spot, come here quickly okuurrrrrr. They're open for takeout during this pandemic. 

Oh and also, the lady at the counter was sooooo sweet! I just love me some good customer service.",2020-05-18 01:21:05

You're greeted by a cozy bar, with drapes on the ceiling. Upstairs, there are many photos adorning the rooms.

The bathroom is nice! There's a framed animated picture, soothing sounds, and bright lights. Astral plane indeed... speaking of which, their menu is amusingly themed - air, water, earth - for different kinds of foods - get it? I ordered a beef dish and received a tender chunk of meat that was seasoned to perfection. I asked for hot sauce and received a nice bottle of a sauce I hadn't had before that was pleasantly piquant.

Servers Tim, Jesse, and Ed (bartender) were friendly and met all of our party's needs (we were about 12 people?).

No place is perfect. It's dark inside - much too dark to see the menu or even the food, I had to use my cell phone for illumination.",2007-04-18 12:52:28

That would be wayyyy back in the 80's.  Astral was, along with Lickety Split and Fri Sat Sun, one of our go to date spots, long before we were married.  We loved the quirky homey feel of the mismatched furniture, China, and flatware, and the general feeling of being in , like everyone says, Grandma's house, yet the vibe was like no one's Grandma's house!! We loved the food!  Never had a bad meal there or even a mediocre meal.  I always had the duck, no matter how it was served- I think my favorite may have been a raspberry sauce. We spent so many New Year's Eves there it was like a tradition!  I miss it so much, even though marriage and kids changed our traditions a bit!  I do find it fitting that one of our college aged twins lives in a dorm on Pine St, just a few blocks from the old Astral site on Lombard.  So sorry he will never have the opportunity to experience Astral.

RIP Astral Plane!   You are well missed!  But not forgotten.",2019-03-03 21:43:33
dQSqORfU8QT3lFWDEbf4Og,W3W6ywndgEOM4mf_DgCb5g,xEoAXOgrUOh-M1NUp6-Kaw,3,1,0,1,"I had a hankering for Pad Thai and the pickings in Ybor are nonexistent, so I swung by Buddha Lounge to try them out.  If you're with pals lunch is fine here, but going solo was mind numbly boring.  The TV at the bar seems to be only for decoration because it was off the entire time I sat there.  The guy behind the bar, John, was cool... when he was there.  He spent most of his time running around the restaurant doing this, that and the other.  Nothing but bottles and a black screen to stare at.  Joy.

I ordered the Pad Thai extra hot because if it's not burning a hole in my stomach lining, it's not real Thai food.  When the dish came out the first thing that caught my attention were the four pieces of lime sitting on top.  That was new.  Plucking them off, I dug into it (friggin' starving at the time).

The heat was pretty good, a sauce based heat as opposed to the pepper based heat I adore.  The pieces of chicken were pretty fatty (like cheap wing meat) and really detracted from the meal.  With my hunger screaming in my belly I had to finish the dish.  Full, but not satisfied was the basic gist of my lunch.

The reason they get 3 stars and that I'm willing to try them again, was my waiter John.  When I mentioned the chicken was too fatty for the dish he offered to buy me dessert.  I'm not really a dessert with lunch kinda guy, so I declined.  When he brought the check I saw there was a discount applied instead.  That's a solid customer service move and totally unexpected.  For that alone, I'll come back and try one of their fried rice dishes which I hear are damn yummy.",2010-06-18 00:55:18
